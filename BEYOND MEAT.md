**BEYOND MEAT**

© Beyond Meat

**What it does**

Beyond Meat is a manufacturer of plant-based meat substitutes which are distributed through retailers and restaurants. The company recognised that all components of animal meat can be analysed, understood and then replicated from plant sources.

**Why we own it**

- —  There is an enormous growth opportunity in the alternative protein market, as both lifestyle choices and environmental concerns are resulting in plant-based products rapidly taking share from animal meat.

- —  Beyond Meat has been a pioneer in its approach, addressing the median carnivorous consumer rather than the vegan/ vegetarian niche, and so aims to at least equal meat in terms of taste, cost, and nutrition.

- —  It benefits from an early mover advantage, a mission-driven culture, and remarkable execution under the leadership of founder Ethan Brown.

  **How it could be worth many times more**

- —  Beyond Meat is looking ‘beyond meat’ with a broader goal of undermining the use of animal derived protein.

- —  Processed meat market is $210bn in the US, $230bn in Europe, $90bn in China, and $11bn in Brazil.

- —  On a ten year view, even with no growth in these markets, a 3% share for Beyond Meat would imply revenues of >$15bn vs a run rate of <$1bn today.

- —  Assuming low teens margins, a degree of dilution to fund growth along the way and a Nestle / Kellogg type rating, a 5x return is comfortably plausible.

- —  The scenario above comes nowhere close to CEO Brown’s aspiration of dominating animal meat, nor does it include China, the world’s largest meat market, where Beyond Meat has partnerships with Alibaba, Starbucks, and Yum! Brands.

  **Where we might be wrong**

- —  Failure to at least equal meat in terms of cost, experience and nutrition means there is no mass shift from animal protein to plant-based alternatives.
- —  Lab grown meat, such as that produced by Impossible Foods, is preferable to consumers.
- —  Competition from lab grown meat.
