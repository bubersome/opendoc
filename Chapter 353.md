\1. **Daily Determination of Price Limits**

For a given Business Day, Price Limits applicable to a futures contract for a given delivery month shall be calculated on the basis of the corresponding Reference Price (Rule 35302.I.1.a.) and the corresponding Offsets (Rule 35302.I.1.b.), as follows:

7% Price Limits = Reference Price minus 7% Offset, and Reference Price plus 7% Offset 13% Price Limit = Reference Price minus 13% Offset
 20% Price Limit = Reference Price minus 20% Offset

For a given Business Day, for futures for a given delivery month, the Exchange shall set a contract

Reference Price identical to the Reference Price determined pursuant to Rule 35802.I.1.a for E- mini Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock Index Futures for the same Business Day.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the start of any Trading Day generally shall coincide with the start of the CME Globex trading session at 5:00 p.m. on the evening first preceding such Trading Day.

For a futures contract for a given delivery month, the Final Settlement Price shall be a special opening quotation of the Index. Such special opening quotation shall be determined on the third Friday of such delivery month and shall be based on opening prices of the component stocks of the Index.

If the Index is not scheduled to be published on the third Friday of the contract delivery month, then such Final Settlement Price shall be scheduled for determination on the first preceding Business Day on which the Index is scheduled to be published.

If the Primary Listing Exchange for a component stock of the Index does not open on the day scheduled for determination of such Final Settlement Price, then for the purpose of calculating such Final Settlement Price the price of such component stock shall be its opening price on the next following day on which its Primary Listing Exchange is open for trading.

If a component stock of the Index does not trade on the day scheduled for determination of such Final Settlement Price, and the Primary Listing Exchange for such stock is open for trading, then for the purpose of calculating such Final Settlement Price the price of such stock shall be its last sale price, provided that the Exchange in its sole discretion may instruct that the price of such stock shall be its opening price on the next following day that it is traded on its Primary Listing Exchange.
