         ### A

         

         ny new business owner knows there is an insane number of tasks involved in launching a business. Just getting your business license, government  filings, and

         finances in order can wear you down, never mind readying the heart of your  business: how to market and sell your goods or services.

         If you’re looking at this book, though, you know that you really should  plan for more than running your business day to day. You should think  about the long term, too. And part of that is considering what you want  to happen when an owner leaves the business.

         It may seem odd to think about ownership changes when you’re just starting out, but sooner or later, an owner will leave— maybe to pursue other  interests, maybe for other reasons. It’s impossible know what your  business will look like in five or ten years. To protect your  investment, you need a plan to deal with these transitions. Without an  exit plan, if you want out of the business in three years, you might  have to leave your money and hard work behind. And without buyout  provisions, what if a co- owner, out of the blue, threatens to liquidate the company if you don’t meet a buyout price you can’t afford—who wins? To avoid disagreements (maybe even lawsuits) and keep the business  going smoothly, you need a buyout agreement that spells out

         the owners’ rights and obligations when an ownership transition occurs.

         You might want to think of a buyout agreement as a type of prenuptial  agreement. Just as a prenup specifies what will happen to shared  property if one spouse wants out of

         a marriage, a buyout agreement lets everybody know what

         

         each owner’s rights will be if someone wants or needs to leave the business. Nobody has to worry about, or fight about, the consequences of a  “breakup”—it’s all been agreed to.

         In this book, you’ll learn:

         - when and how to allow an owner to request a buyout

         - when a buyout should be required (for example, after disability, divorce, bankruptcy, retirement, or death)

         - how to restrict who can buy into the company

         - how to value the business and each owner’s share

         - how to set up payment terms to make future buyouts affordable, and

         - how to provide the funds for future buyouts.

           Creating a buyout agreement may sound like a task you should hand over to a  lawyer—after all, you’ve got a lot on your plate already. But the truth  is you can prepare one yourself easily using the agreement on the CD-ROM that comes with this book. The book will help you pick the options in  the agreement that best suit your business situation. Then you can open  the CD-ROM and fill in some blanks in the agreement—just as if you went  to a lawyer’s

           office, where they use fill-in-the-blanks agreements every day. (And if you do  hire a lawyer to create your buyout agreement, you’ll be ahead of the  game because you’ll understand the key issues. A little knowledge may  save you a lot on the lawyer’s bill.)

           The important part of creating a buyout agreement is making personal  decisions about your business. A lawyer can’t do that for you. Only you  can decide, for instance, whether you want you and your co-owners to  have the ability to force a buyout, and under what circumstances, at  what price, and according to what payment terms.

           We provide the legal and tax information you need to make these decisions. We even include a worksheet where you can record your choices and  thoughts as you go through the issues in the book with your co-owners.  Along the way, there may be areas where your situation is complicated  enough that you should seek advice from a lawyer or tax accountant.  We’ll let you know when you need outside help.

           **IntroductIon** | YOUR LEgAL COMPANION FOR CREATINg A BUYOUT AgREEMENT | **3**

           

           When you’re done, you’ll know that you’ve done the most important thing you  can do when starting a business: ensured that if and when you don’t want to (or can’t) continue in the business, you’ll have an exit strategy in place so that you can get your money without a lawsuit. And if another  owner wants to leave, you'll be able to keep the business going with you at the helm.

           We hope that this book, with its step-by-step process for creating a  buyout agreement that makes sense for your business, will help you relax and get to the good part: making your business a success.

           ### t

           

           he first days and months of a new business are busy times. The last thing  you have time for is worrying about what will happen when you or another owner wants to get out of the

           business—or becomes disabled, gets divorced, or dies. Unfortunately, it’s a huge  mistake to ignore the fact that, sooner or later, your business will  lose owners and perhaps gain new ones. After all, do you know what  you’ll be doing five or ten years from now? You

           can’t be sure that the business will fulfill all of your financial and emotional needs and  that you’ll want to stay involved forever. You can be sure about one  thing, however: You will leave your business at some point, whether it  is to start another company, become an employee somewhere else, move,  retire, or, god forbid, become disabled or die when you’re not expecting it.

           If you are the owner who leaves first, you don’t want to leave your  investment and hard work behind. You need a way to convert your business interest into money that you can take with you. To make sure this  happens, you and your co-owners may want to agree that the company or  the co-owners will buy out an owner who wants or needs to leave—at least under certain circumstances.

           Or, if it turns out that you are the owner who wants to stay with the  company for the long haul, losing an owner or gaining a new one may  throw you off course. When ownership interests change hands, conflicts  often arise that can upset the functioning of a small, closely managed  company. If you doubt this even for a minute, quickly skim the following questions:

         - What if one of your co-owners demands you buy him out for an unreasonable  price, at a time when the company is under financial strain?

         - What if your longtime friend and business partner gets Alzheimer’s disease?  Can you buy out his share? Can the person’s caretaker force you to buy  the share?

         - What if one of your co-owners becomes alcohol or drug dependent or loses her professional license? Can she be expelled?

           

           - What if a co-owner gets divorced and her ex-husband ends up with part ownership because of the divorce settlement?

           - What if the majority owner of your company wants to sell his share to a stranger?

           - What if an older co-owner wants to give half of his interest to his  notoriously irresponsible son, who has never worked for the company, and elect him to the board?

             The answer to all these dilemmas is the same. If you haven’t made a sound  agreement to anticipate and deal with these issues before they happen,  you’re taking a risk that friction will arise between owners who will  remain at the company and a new owner or a departing owner. Much of the  time, this tension occurs because the continuing owners do not want to  be forced to work with and share control of the company with an  unqualified, inactive, or unlikable new owner. (After all, most small  business owners own their own businesses because they want to run things their way,

             or at least share management with co-owners with whom they can comfortably and easily deal.)

             When such owner-to-owner tension arises, it can lead to serious personal and business discord, which might even be fought out in court or result in  the demise of your company. Put bluntly, if you do not have a buyout  agreement, here is what may happen:

           - If a stranger is allowed to buy the interest of a departing co- owner, or a family member of a deceased or divorced owner receives an interest, the new owner may be inexperienced or untrustworthy; this could end up  hurting the company’s bottom line.

           - If a co-owner is forced to file for personal bankruptcy or defaults on a  personal loan secured by his ownership interest in the business, you may be stuck co-owning the company with a bankruptcy trustee or creditor.  This can create business delays and prevent you from getting bank loans.

           - If a co-owner—or the co-owner’s inheritors—want to be bought out, you and  your co-owners may argue endlessly over what price should be paid for  the interest that is

             

             changing hands, resulting in an angry deadlock that spills over into business operations.

         - If you leave the company or die, you or your survivors may be stuck with a small business interest that no outsider wants to buy and for which no  insider (co-owner) will give you a decent price.

           To avoid these conflicts, you and your co-owners should arrange matters so you’ll be able to collectively control who will own and manage the  company in the future. In other words, if someone wants to buy into the  company, you and the other owners can have a say. If an owner wants to  give his share to his kids, you and the other owners may want say no. If an owner wants to retire but hold on to his interest, you and the other owners may want to rearrange things. That’s why it’s best to set some  ground rules ahead of time. Enter the buyout agreement (sometimes also  called a buy-sell agreement or a business continuity agreement).

           Much like a prenuptial agreement, a buyout agreement gives owners a way to  deal with ownership disruptions in a way that won’t wreck their  business, by providing preestablished rules for transferring interests.  After all, you probably started your own business to work with people  you enjoy and to control your own destiny. A buyout agreement will make  sure it stays that way.

           Of course, planning in advance to contend with likely disputes is not the  same thing as saying you can prevent change—for good or bad, your  company’s ownership situation is almost sure to be different five years  hence. But you can plan for transitions with a buyout agreement—to make  the transition process as positive and as smooth as possible—and put  your mind at ease.

           

           What a Buy-Sell, or Buyout, Agreement Can Do

           Contrary to popular belief, a buy-sell agreement is not about buying and selling companies. A buy-sell agreement is a binding contract— between you and  your co-owners—that controls when an owner can

           

           sell his interest, who can buy an owner’s interest, when the company or  co-owners must buy another owner’s interest, and what price will be paid for that interest. In this book, we use the terms “buy-sell agreement”  and “buyout agreement” interchangeably.

           

           Guarantee a Buyer for Your Ownership Interest

           At a time when many people demand that their work be both profitable and  personally meaningful, you may decide that the business is not working  out for you as you expected, or you may no longer get along with one of  your co-owners, or you may even have to move to another city because  your spouse takes a new job. Whatever the reason, you’ll no doubt want  to turn the value of your share of the business into cash—to provide you with retirement funds, seed money for another project, or even a down  payment on a vacation house.

           

           The Problem

           If at some point you want to leave the business but your co-owners won’t  pay a fair price for your interest, without a buy-sell agreement you  could be stuck with a share of the company, instead of having cash to  spend or invest elsewhere. Why?

           Your co-owners may not want to part with the money it would take to buy you  out—at least not at the price you want. And you’re not likely to have  luck selling to a third party either. It’s often impossible to find an  interested buyer for part ownership of a company, especially if you’re  trying to sell a minority interest.

           It shouldn’t come as a surprise that it can be quite difficult to sell a  less-than-100% share of a small business. A minority share gives an  owner little or no control over how the business is run. Think

           of it this way: If your dream has been to own and run your own business,  would you be likely to settle for a tiny piece of someone else’s?  Probably not—if you are like most people.

           

           The Solution

           If the time comes when you want or need to sell your ownership interest,  having a buyout agreement that provides for forced buyouts can end up  protecting you and your family from financial hardship and hard  feelings. A buyout agreement can give you the right to force the company or the co-owners to buy you out under certain circumstances, and at a  set price. A buy-sell agreement typically gives owners this right when  any of the following occur:

         - An owner decides to move on to something else or to retire after a certain period of time.

         - An owner becomes disabled and is no longer able to actively participate in the company.

         - An owner dies, and the estate representative or inheritors want to sell  his interest back to the company or the continuing owners.

           For instance, if you have to move out of state for family reasons and want  to sell your ownership interest, or you become disabled and can no  longer work, your agreement could require your company or co-owners to  buy your share from you. In effect, this type of provision “makes a  market” for your interest where one might not naturally exist.

           Or, if you die unexpectedly, requiring the company to buy back your  interest from your estate provides financial stability for your  heirs—assuming they would inherit your chunk of the company after you  die.

           

           exAMpLe: Dean, Ivan, and Winter, coworkers in a large cosmetics company, quit their  jobs to form a natural cosmetics corporation. Unfortunately, although  they spend a lot of time developing a business plan and organizing their business, they do not create an agreement or mechanism to fund a  buyout, should one of them want to sell out.

           Three years after the corporation was formed and just when it is beginning to earn substantial profits, Ivan dies, soon after his fiftieth birthday.  His wife and two children each inherit an

           

           equal number of his shares. But his wife is strapped for cash, and his kids,  just entering college, also need money. Neither his wife nor the kids  are interested in continuing the business. Dean and Winter don’t feel  the company can afford to pay the true value of Ivan’s shares to his  family, and they know that Ivan’s heirs probably can’t find an outside  buyer. They plead poverty and initially refuse to buy the shares. Ivan’s wife and kids are stuck. Dean and Winter finally agree to buy their  shares for far less than they were really worth, by making small  payments to the family over five years.

           

           This is not an uncommon situation in small businesses. Often, when an owner  dies, the last thing family members want to do is pick up the business  where the owner left off. But families who are grieving the loss of a  loved one may also suffer financially, from living expenses, funeral  costs, and death taxes. In that case, it’s really necessary for an  inheritor who does not want to carry on the business to be able to offer her interest to the company and the remaining owners of the company and be guaranteed that they’ll buy it for a fair price.

           We look at the ways a buy-sell agreement can provide forced buyout rights in Chapter 3, “Providing the Right to Force Buyouts.”

           

           Control Who Can Own an Interest in the Company

           When the shoe is on the other foot, and you’re the one who wants to stay  while another owner leaves, you’ll want some guidelines in place to keep the ownership and control of your company stable and the business  solvent. This may happen when a co-owner is not getting along and wants  to sell out or simply feels like doing something else.

           

           The Problem

           As discussed above, an outsider who gains an ownership interest could  disrupt business as usual and trigger major problems in any

           

           small company’s management. For example, a new owner with different goals  might not see eye to eye with the existing owners on the election of the management team (board of directors, general partners, or limited  liability company managers) or the approval of important management  decisions. And since unanimous agreement of all owners is required for  certain decisions, a new owner could hold up important company actions.

           Even worse, an unwanted outsider in a corporation, especially one who buys  or inherits a large block of shares, can gain control by electing  herself to the board of directors. Once a person becomes a board member, that person becomes an equal participant on

           the board. Let’s look at how an unwelcome outsider can disrupt a company’s management.

           

           exAMpLe: Cousins Xavier and Yolanda incorporate a small business, with Xavier receiving  55% of the corporation’s shares and Yolanda 45%. Each cousin serves as a director of the corporation. A few years later, Xavier and Yolanda have a

           falling out over whether to significantly expand the business. To escape from  the resulting tension, Xavier sells his 55% interest to Richard, a  wealthy investor Yolanda doesn’t even know, and sets off to spend his  days sailing the sunlit Caribbean.

           Richard elects himself to the board of directors to fill Xavier’s seat. He  immediately proposes laying off several loyal employees in order to  maximize short-term profits, with an eye toward making a quick and  lucrative sale of the company. This horrifies Yolanda, who is interested in the long-term health and growth

           of the business. Richard and Yolanda quickly reach an impasse in corporate decision making, and Yolanda files a minority- shareholder lawsuit,  trying to unseat Richard. This escalates their personal and professional conflicts, with the result that the company’s day-to-day operations  practically come to a standstill.

           

           Likewise, in an unincorporated business, an outsider can sometimes take control  automatically by becoming a majority owner in the partnership or limited liability company (LLC).

           

           The Solution

           When an owner is contemplating selling or giving away his interest, a good  buyout agreement steps in to give the continuing owners some control  over the transaction, often regulating who can buy the departing owner’s interest and at what price, or, sometimes, whether the owner can sell  his interest at all. The agreement gives the continuing owners the tools to prevent outsiders from buying in.

           Usually a buyout agreement gives the company and its owners the opportunity to  buy out an owner who stops working for the company. By so doing, it  eliminates the possibility that active owners will be forced to share  profits with an inactive owner. A buyout agreement can also give owners  the right to purchase an owner’s interest after he dies rather than  allow his inheritors to become owners.

           In fact, a typical buyout agreement gives the company and the owners the  right to buy out an owner (that is, force an unwilling owner to sell) in all of these situations:

           - The owner becomes disabled and is no longer able to actively participate in the company.

           - The owner’s ex-spouse stands to receive an ownership interest in the company as part of a divorce settlement.

           - The owner’s interest is in danger of being confiscated by creditors (because of a personal bankruptcy or foreclosure of a debt).

           - The owner decides to retire from active participation in the company.

           - The owner dies.

             We discuss these options in Chapter 2, “Limiting the Transfer of Ownership Interests,” and Chapter 3, “Providing the Right to Force Buyouts.”

             

             Set a Price for a Buyout

             An important part of adopting a well-thought-out buyout agreement is  setting a price at which ownership interests will be transferred.

             Without having an established price for the company in advance—or at least a  formula for setting the price—lengthy disputes and lawsuits can arise  over the value of an ownership interest. Not only are these  disagreements almost sure to result in personal ill will, but they may  even disrupt the ongoing business to the point that the company loses  its edge and is in danger of failing.

             However, it can be difficult to value a small or family-owned business. Sure,  you can add up the value of property, equipment, and accounts  receivable, but what about the value of your customer lists and your  business’s reputation—sometimes known as the “going concern” value?  Should these assets get factored into the equation?

             And, of course, whatever number you come up with, a departing business  partner could have a different idea of the company’s worth: The  departing owner could be thinking of a price based on the increasing  profits over the last three years, while you may be fearful that the  owner’s departure is going to hurt sales or make the business’s future  uncertain.

             We discuss setting a price for buyouts in Chapter 6.

             

             Arrange a Payment Method for a Buyout

             Likewise, a company that doesn’t plan *how* it will pay a departing owner (or that person’s family members) can be in for trouble.

             Having to come up with a large lump-sum payment out of the blue can cause a  company to drown in financial hot waters. These issues can be extremely  problematic if a payment schedule is not deter- mined until the time  when the ownership interest has to be bought back. For instance, if an  owner wants the company to buy back his interest and pay for it on the  spot, the company may need to borrow the cash (of course, some can’t) or liquidate assets to make the payment.

             

             Fortunately, a good buyout agreement can set forth the mechanics of a  buyout—including specific payment terms. A buy- sell agreement can  provide that a departing owner (or the owner’s family members) can be  paid in installments, perhaps from company revenues, over a period of  years, which will be more affordable for the continuing owners than a  lump-sum payment.

             We discuss payment methods for buyouts in Chapter 7.

             

             Fund a Buyout

             To cover the possibility of an owner’s death or disability, one common  funding method is to require the purchase of life or disability  insurance for each of the business owners—and then use the policy  proceeds to buy an owner out if an owner dies or becomes disabled.  Without a funding mechanism, in some cases your company’s only other  option might be to liquidate or file for bankruptcy—something you surely want to avoid.

             

             exAMpLe: Imagine the same circumstances as the above example, except this time Dean,  Ivan, and Winter create a buy-sell agreement at the outset. The  agreement protects the

             owners’ inheritors by requiring the corporation to buy back an inheritor’s  interest at a price based on a professional appraisal. It also provides  that the buyout will be funded with company- purchased life insurance.  The life insurance proceeds will keep

             the remaining owners from having to take out loans or sell assets to  execute the buyout. Thanks to the buy-sell agreement, Ivan’s wife and  kids receive a reasonable sum for their shares, at no financial strain  to the company.

             

             In addition to, or in combination with, funding a buyout with insurance,  if you plan ahead, departing owners can be partially compensated with  deferred compensation or retirement plans. We discuss funding buyouts  further in Chapter 5.

             

             Tying It All Together

             It is your job (along with your co-owners) to decide which of these  provisions you want to include in your buyout agreement. After reading  the first part of this book, which explains the various buyout options  mentioned above and how they can be used, you and your co-owners will  choose the buyout provisions you think are suitable for your company and your situation. You’ll select provisions for your agreement depending  on several factors, including how long you expect to own your business,  whether you want to keep your company very small and private, and who  you expect to succeed you when you die.

             

             When Should You Create a Buyout Agreement?

             Procrastination is a vice most of us share, and that includes many small business  owners, no matter how shrewd they may be. Unfor- tunately, in the area  of business planning, it can lead to financial undoing. Many owners of  successful businesses put off creating a buyout agreement—because they  don’t have time, or they think nothing’s going to change—until it’s too  late. In short, no matter what stage you’re at in the business game, the time to create a buy- out agreement is now.

             When you’re forming a new business, by the time you have the notion that you need to talk about “What happens if …,” fatigue has probably set in.  Often little energy is left over for hashing out the provisions of a  buyout agreement. But creating your buy-sell agreement need not be an  arduous ordeal. For instance, there’s

             no need to spend a lot of time on complex valuation formulas (for example, the capitalization-of-earnings method) when you’re just starting out.  In fact, you couldn’t use one of the more complicated formulas early on  even if you wanted to—they require that you have a few years of earnings history. Later, as the worth of your company grows, and as you develop  an earnings record, you can refine your valuation formula to reflect  changes in the company’s assets and earnings.

             

             The key to a buyout agreement is that all owners agree to a reasonable plan early on, before anyone knows who will be most affected by it. Think of it this way: At the outset, each owner’s concerns are roughly the same, because no owner knows who will be the first to leave. Or put another  way, it’s only when no one wants to sell out that everyone has the same  interest in creating an evenhanded buyout agreement that’s fair to all  owners.

             Not coincidentally, the best time to discuss these issues is during the  formation stage of your company, when you’re already discussing other  potentially sensitive issues—such as the amount each owner will invest,  the salaries or draws each owner-employee will take home, and the  policies that will guide your company.

             New owners sometimes worry that focusing on problems surrounding an owner’s leaving casts a shadow over their new business. Just the opposite is  true: Facing the fact that problems can arise and that negative things  do happen can be healthy for your business relationship. Airing  concerns, and perhaps a little dirty laundry, often helps you to head  potential problems off or, if that’s impossible, to be sure they will be handled smoothly, without putting your business’s survival at risk.  Knowing that possible changes are covered and planned for can act as a  reality check and

             a stabilizing force and can increase your trust in what the future will be like.

             No one may want to bring up the awkward issue of what happens if the  owners stop getting along or if someone wants out of the business before the others do. But making decisions together with your co-owners from  the start can make a world of difference in the future of your company  because it requires you to discuss major questions that affect your  future. Begin by being frank with your co-owners now.

             

             Does Everyone Need a Buy-Sell Agreement?

             Almost every business should have a buyout agreement. In only a few situations, a buyout agreement may not be necessary:

             

         - one owner. If you are a sole proprietor—you own 100% of a company—you probably do not need a buy-sell agreement, unless you plan on selling the business to  an employee who is willing and able to take over (see “Employee Buyouts” in Chapter 5).

         - Married owners. If you and your spouse (with whom divorce is highly unlikely) own 100% of a company, there normally is little reason to bother creating a buy-sell  agreement.

           It’s unlikely that either of you will want to get out of the company unless  you both do, and if one of you dies while you still own the business,  the other person will probably inherit the ownership interest.

         - parent/child owners. If you co-own your small business with your son or daughter (alone) and  you plan to leave your share of the business to them at your death, you  may want to forgo a buy-sell agreement and just put your wishes in a  will or trust (unless your estate may owe estate taxes—see “Estate Tax  Issues” in Chapter 9). But even here there is always the possibility  that your child will die, divorce, or want to leave the business before  you do, so an agreement still makes sense.

           In short, there may be some situations where it is unlikely you’ll need  the protection of a buyout agreement, but you usually take some sort of  risk by not having one.

           

           How to Create Your Agreement

           Throughout the first part of this book, we present and explain various buyout  provisions you can use to handle ownership transition issues, from  deciding which potential problems may affect you and your company to  choosing how you’d prefer to handle these dilemmas.

           We provide a lot of the legal and tax information you need to make informed choices about the future of your company, including

           

           the following major issues that will help you decide on the terms of your buyout agreement:

           - how to put limits on to whom an owner can transfer his interest (Chapter 2)

           - how to provide for forced buyouts in certain circumstances (Chapter 3)

           - how the procedure works for buyouts in the future (Chapter 4)

           - how to fund future buyouts (Chapter 5)

           - how to set the price that will be paid for ownership interests (Chapter 6)

           - how to set the terms of payment (such as an installment plan) (Chapter 7), and

           - how buy-sell agreements can affect ordinary income and capital gains taxes and estate taxes (Chapter 9).

             Throughout the book, after introducing you to these concepts, we help you choose  the provisions that are right for your company. This book will be your  companion in making these decisions with your co-owners, providing  practical and supportive information along the way.

             To keep track of the options that interest you, and any related thoughts  you may have, we provide you with a worksheet that follows the order of  the chapters and the issues we discuss.

             Before you start reading Chapter 2, tear out the worksheet from Appendix B,  and keep it by your side while you’re reading. The text will prompt you  to check various options and jot down any relevant notes on your  worksheet.

             Finally, when you’ve gone through the book, you’ll simply transfer your choices  from your worksheet to the blank buyout agreement we provide by filling  in the blanks. (The agreement comes as a tear-out form in Appendix C and as a word processing document on the CD-ROM.) Then you’ll print it out  and have

             all owners sign it. Later on, during an ownership transition, the  provisions you choose will remind you and your co-owners how you agreed  to handle a potential buyout situation.

             

             One practical suggestion: Take it easy. As you read through the book for  the first time, you may feel a bit discombobulated by the numerous  possibilities that can be covered in a buy-sell agreement. Expect to  feel a bit overwhelmed. Not every company needs to cover every  contingency. And there’s no need to grasp every detail the

             first time through. Start by reading the entire book to get a rough  understanding of what’s involved and making a few observations on your  worksheet about what situations or provisions might be particularly  applicable to you.

             Then spend time considering what you want to happen to your business when  you are no longer in charge. Creating a buy- sell agreement has  important, long-term consequences for you and

             your family, and your finances. Allow plenty of time for discussions with  your co-owners—talk, argue, and speculate. Perhaps give each owner a  worksheet of their own to fill out. When you’re ready, go back, focus on the areas of most concern and begin to pin down exactly what you want  in your agreement.

             After you select the appropriate buyout options and you all sign your buyout  agreement, it will then probably sit quietly in a dusty file folder  until one of you wants to part with your ownership interest or until an  event happens that causes the company or co- owners to want to buy out  an owner. When one of these circum- stances occurs, the buyout agreement will kick in to protect your investment.

             

             When to Seek a Lawyer’s Advice

             While we provide a lot of information in this book to help you create your  buy-sell agreement, we cannot provide the depth of advice, especially in the tax and estate planning realms, that a buy-sell or financial  planner or a tax expert can provide. Since we don’t know you and your  particular business, we can’t customize an agreement for you that  exactly suits your company’s and each owner’s individual needs, though  we do make every attempt to

             

             provide different alternatives and tips on customizing your own agreement.

             So, in general, we recommend you bring your draft buyout agreement to a  small business tax or legal adviser before putting your finalized  agreement into action. Consultations of this sort are invaluable to make sure that you have considered all the relevant tax angles and the  contingencies that apply to your particular business and to make sure  you base your agreement on the very latest tax information and  strategies. In addition, a lawyer can make sure that your new buyout  provisions don’t conflict with existing provisions of your business’s  organizational documents—your articles or bylaws or partnership  agreement or LLC operating agreement. (For more information, see  “Finalizing Your Buyout Agreement” in Chapter 8.)

             Some situations may even merit a conversation with a lawyer or tax planner before you create your buy-sell agreement:

           - Family business owners. If you own a family business and your plan is to have children or other  relatives succeed you, you may need some extra help with succession  planning— issues of inheritance and estate taxes can be complicated for  family businesses. And although some family members may not want to  consider the chance that there may be

             disagreements in the future, the truth is that serious disputes can and often do arise in family businesses—just as they

             do in families themselves. We discuss issues that apply to passing the  family business from one generation to the next in “Family Succession  Agreements,” in Chapter 3, but families with high-value businesses or  those with complex succession plans may need to bring in advisers (tax  experts or estate planners) to help them mesh their buy-sell provisions  with their estate planning needs.

           - Minority/majority owners. If you will own a small minority or a large majority of a business, or you are a silent investor in a company, you may want to seek legal advice  that’s tailored to your circumstance. You may have some extra concerns  that we don’t fully address in this book. This book is geared

             

             toward companies with two or more owners who are unrelated, who own roughly  equal shares of the business, and who actively participate in the  day-to-day management or operations of the business.

         - owners with different situations. If the needs or circum- stances of the owners are substantially different, and the owners’ initial capital contributions will be quite high, each  owner may wish to check out the tax and estate planning repercussions  with his or her individual tax adviser or financial planner.

         - older owners. If you are in your fifties or sixties and are forming a new company with  others and contributing a lot of cash or property, you may want to  consult an estate planner before you adopt your agreement. In  particular, choosing the right valuation formula early on can have a  minimizing effect on estate taxes when you or a co-owner dies. We  discuss estate taxes as they relate to buy-sell agreements in Chapter 9.

If you decide to have an expert prepare your buyout agreement rather than  do it yourself, you’ll benefit greatly by understanding the critical  issues, your options, and having thought about your expectations for the future of the company. You may want to create a draft of a buyout  agreement—or at least fill out the worksheet in the appendix—and bring  it with you to your first meeting with a lawyer, along with any  questions you have. It will help your planner

immensely in knowing where you’re at and what you want out of an agreement, and may save you time and money.

In Chapter 10, we discuss how to find an attorney, or legal “coach”—a  helpful professional who will review your buy-sell agreement for you. ●

## I



n an age when many people change jobs or even careers a number of times  during their adult life, and when businesses are opened and closed with  head-spinning speed, it’s a risky

bet that you and all of your co-owners will be doing the same thing even  five years from now. At some point during the life of your business, you or one of your business’s co-owners will

probably want to sell your interest in the business and move on to do something  else. For that reason, the most common event that can disrupt a small  business involves an owner’s wanting to sell or transfer her interest in the company.



Transfers of Ownership Interests

One way an owner might try to transfer her interest is to sell it to an  outside buyer (anyone not a current owner)—assuming she’s lucky enough  to find one. Another, probably more likely, scenario is for the company  to buy back an owner’s interest or for one or more of her co-owners to  purchase her share. Or, for estate planning purposes, an older owner may want to transfer all or part of her ownership interest to a trust or  give it to her children.

To help you and your co-owners maintain control of your company, it’s  essential to create, in advance, an impartial method for reviewing  potential ownership transfers and blocking any undesirable ones. The  best way to do this is to adopt a buyout provision that gives the  company or co-owners the right to buy an

owner’s interest before it’s sold, given away, or otherwise transferred (this  is called a “right of first refusal”). This provision covers all of the  scenarios discussed above; essentially, it covers any attempt by an  owner to transfer an ownership interest in the company by sale or gift  or to a trust.

The provisions in this chapter apply only to voluntary, lifetime transfers  of owners’ interests by sale or gift or to a trust. They do not apply to court-ordered transfers to bankruptcy trustees or to ex-spouses as part of a divorce, to transfers to an owner’s estate or beneficiaries upon  death, or to other *involuntary* transfers. Other



buyout provisions in our buyout agreement, discussed in Chapter 3, cover these additional types of involuntary transfers.



Using a Right of First Refusal

To avoid the possibility that an unwanted person might buy (or otherwise  be transferred) an interest in your business, most buyout agreements  sensibly contain a “Right of First Refusal” provision. This type of  provision requires an owner to first offer his interest for sale to his  company and co-owners before selling it or transferring it to anyone  else. Depending on the needs of your company, you may want this type of  restriction to apply only when an owner considers transferring his  interest to an outsider. But there can also be reasons why you might  want this type of restriction to apply when an owner is considering  transferring his interest to an insider—a current owner.



Selling an Interest to an Outside Buyer

Should a co-owner have the unconditional right to transfer his interest in the business to someone who is not already an owner of the company?  Although at first thought you might be tempted to say, “Why shouldn’t an owner be able to do whatever he wants with his interest?”—think again.



The Problem

Consider that if you happen to be one of the continuing owners in the company,  you might be horrified if a co-owner were to sell out to an unqualified  or unlikable new owner, who—even if she purchased a minority share—would have the power to make your life miserable. And, of course, things  would be far worse if an

outsider stood to gain a *majority* interest in your company, since this would give her an opportunity to all but take your company away from you.



exAMpLe: Brothers Nigel and Aidan, along with Aidan’s wife, Monica, open a boutique  computer store and service business. They create a corporation with each relative owning a one- third stock interest and each serving as a board member. No

buyout agreement is prepared. A few years later, after the service part of the business has become successful, they receive a favorable buyout offer  from a competitor—an owner of a chain of inexpensive computer stores.  Nigel has no interest in selling his shares—he wants to keep the  business in the family and eventually have his daughter Emilia succeed  him. Aidan and Monica, on the other hand, have been looking forward to  early retirement and jump at what they see as a golden opportunity

to cash out. Since neither the corporate law in their state nor the  corporation’s bylaws require all owners to approve a transfer of an  owner’s shares in the corporation, Aidan and Monica sign

a contract to sell their two-thirds ownership in the company to the chain operator. The new owner quickly votes her newly

acquired, two-thirds controlling interest to elect herself and her husband to  fill the two recently vacated board seats. Nigel is left with a  one-third interest in a business that he can no longer run  independently.

TIP

An outside buyer might be a boon to the company. Not every



new owner would make things worse, especially an owner who buys an equal or minority interest. In the real world, the continuing owners may think  highly of a person who wants to buy the departing owner’s share. And, of course, there can be a real incentive for the continuing owners to  allow a new owner to buy in, since it means they won’t have to reach  into their own pockets

to pay the departing owner or ask their company to pony up the cash. Or,  sometimes a change in ownership is just what’s needed to pep up a sleepy or flagging business. If it looks like it may work out that everyone is happy with the new ownership situation, invoking a buyout restriction  won’t even be needed.



The key point here is that you won’t know what the situation will be—or  what new owner will come along—until it happens. In case things aren’t  so rosy, it’s good to have an agreement in place to allow the continuing owners of the company—not the departing owner—to make the decision  about who should take part in the company’s ownership and future.

It’s best for all owners to adopt buyout rules for forced buyouts well in  advance of the need to use them. When the business is being formed, or  in its early days, no owner knows how circumstances will change—so it’s  usually not difficult to do this. Since each owner could be the first or last to leave, all are motivated at that time to adopt an even-handed  agreement.



The Solution

A Right-of-First-Refusal provision gives the company, and usually the  continuing owners individually, the choice to buy a co-owner’s interest  before an outsider is allowed to make a purchase (or other- wise receive an interest in the company). If the continuing owners decide they do  not want to work with a prospective new owner, the company or the owners individually can exercise their right to buy the transferring owner’s  interest. On the other hand, if the owners approve of the potential new  owner, they can elect not to buy the

co-owner’s interest—essentially approving the sale (or other transfer).

Here are the details of how our Right-of-First-Refusal provision works with  respect to potential sales of an interest by an owner to an outsider.  (We discuss how our clause covers sales to insiders and gifts of  interests—two other common types of transfers—later in this chapter.)  When an owner receives an offer from an outsider to buy her ownership  interest, a Right-of-First-Refusal provision requires that owner (let’s  call her the “transferring owner”) to submit written notice to the  company of her intent to sell her interest (a “Notice of Intent to  Transfer”). The Notice of Intent to Transfer must include

the price and payment terms of the proposed sale and the name and address  of the proposed buyer. A copy of the offer from the proposed buyer must  be attached.



The company and the continuing owners then have an option to buy the interest (either at the same price and payment terms

as that offered by the outsider or a different price and payment terms,  depending on which price option is checked in the buyout agreement—also  discussed below).

If the company and the continuing owners decline to purchase all of the  transferring owner’s interest, the transferring owner is free to sell  her interest to the outsider. The transferring owner must, however,  transfer her interest to the outsider within 60 days, at

the same price and terms stated in her written notice, or she must start  the whole process over again before transferring her interest. For  example, if the transferring owner wishes to lower the price to be paid  by the outsider for her interest, or wishes to change other terms of the sale to the outsider to make them more favorable (for example, a lower  interest rate on installment payments or a longer payment term), she  must submit to the company a new notice— essentially starting the  process over again for the transfer of the interest under the new terms. On the other hand, if the company and/or the continuing owners decide  they do want to purchase the entire ownership interest, the outsider is  out of luck. The company and/or the continuing owners then buy the  interest from the transferring owner within a certain period of time.  The Right-of-First- Refusal clause included in our buy-sell agreement is shown below.

Section II: Limiting the transfer of ownership Interests

- option 1:  right of First refusal

1. No owner (“transferring owner”) shall have the right to sell, transfer, or dispose of in any way any or all of his or her ownership interest, for  consideration or otherwise, unless he or she delivers to the company  written Notice of Intent

   to Transfer the interest stating the name and the address of the proposed  transferee and the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer.  Delivery of this notice shall be deemed

   an offer by the transferring owner to sell to the company and the continuing owners the interest proposed to be transferred.

   If the proposed transfer is a sale of the owner’s interest, these terms  shall include the price to be paid for the interest by the proposed  transferee, and a copy of the offer to purchase the interest on these  terms, dated and signed by the proposed transferee, shall be attached to the notice.

2. The company and the nontransferring owners then have an option, but not an  obligation (unless otherwise stated in this agreement), to purchase the  interest proposed for

   transfer, and may do so within the time and according to the procedure in Section IV, Provision 1 of this agreement.

   If the company and the nontransferring owners do not elect to purchase all of the interest stated in the notice, the transferring owner may then  transfer his or her interest to the proposed transferee stated in the  notice within 60 days after the end of the nontransferring owners’  purchase option, according to the procedure in Section IV, Provision 1  of this agreement.

   

   exAMpLe: Jason, Tim, Chris, and Bart are four equal share- holders and directors of a  small adventure travel corporation called Run-a-Muck. Jason wants to  sell his shares to an outsider, Austin. According to the  Right-of-First-Refusal provision in the corporation’s buy-sell  agreement, Jason must first get a signed written offer from Austin, then notify the corporation of his intent to sell his shares to Austin. The  price and payment terms of the proposed sale must be included in the  notice to the corporation, with a copy of Austin’s offer attached.  Jason’s Notice of Intent to Transfer is simple, and it reads as follows:

   

   

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_013.gif)

   Notice of Intent to Transfer

   I, Jason Thomas, propose to sell 250 shares in Run-a-Muck to Austin  Johnson within 60 days of the date of this notice for $2,500.00 cash  ($10.00 per share). Payment of the purchase price by Austin Johnson is  to be made in cash on the date of the transfer. A copy of the offer to  purchase these shares on these terms, signed by Austin Johnson, is  attached to this notice.

   

   Run-a-Muck’s Right-of-First-Refusal provision states that the corporation and the  continuing shareholders have 60 days from receipt of the notice to  purchase all of Jason’s shares. If they don’t elect to purchase the  shares, Jason is free to sell them to Austin according to the terms of  Austin’s offer. Faced with Jason’s notice of a proposed sale, Tim,  Chris, and Bart promptly meet

   as board members and decide that Run-a-Muck, Inc. itself will purchase  Jason’s shares, shutting Austin out of the company. Run-a-Muck then buys and cancels Jason’s shares.

   

   Price to be Paid for the Ownership Interest

   What about price? How much should a transferring owner be paid for her  share? Often a Right-of-First-Refusal provision gives the company and  the nontransferring owners the right to purchase the transferring  owner’s interest at the price the proposed buyer is willing to pay  (assuming the interest is being sold, not gifted). In

   other words, the company and the other owners have to match this price or allow the sale to take place.

   One potential problem with this approach is that a disaffected owner may be tempted to solicit a phony outside bid, perhaps from a good friend or  relative, to prod her co-owners into buying her ownership interest at an inflated price. To help cope with

   this possibility, our Right-of-First-Refusal provision requires that a  written offer for the purchase of an ownership interest, signed by the  proposed buyer, be attached to the transferring owner’s Notice of Intent to Transfer. Of course, this is no real guarantee that the offer is  genuine, but at least it makes the purported buyer sign a commitment to  buy the interest—most people will not want to sign such a statement  unless they truly intend to buy the interest.

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_014.png)

   TIP

   You can also require a down payment. Some owners may want

   

   to go even further and require that the proposed buyer tender a  significant down payment to the transferring owner as evidence of good  faith, and that the transferring owner present evidence of this payment  (check or money order) with the copy of the signed, written offer  presented to the company.

   

   You can avoid this problem altogether by having your agree- ment provide  that the company or continuing owners buy an owner’s interest under a  Right of First Refusal at a set price (called the “Agreement Price”),  predetermined in the buyout agreement itself. In this case, even if the  transferring owner receives a higher offer from the outsider, she must  sell to the company or the continuing owners at the Agreement Price, if  they so desire. This

   

   alternative has the virtue of protecting the continuing owners from being forced  into business with an outsider who is willing to pay an inflated  price—one that the continuing owners can’t afford or aren’t willing to  match. Of course, this provision is weighted heavily toward the  interests of the continuing owners and is less favorable to a  transferring owner, who could end up selling her interest for less than  it’s really worth. Setting an agreement price in covered in Chapter 6.

   TIP

   using the Agreement price may help avoid estate taxes. In a

   

   limited number of circumstances, there is an additional reason to require the  transferring owner to sell at the agreement’s predetermined buyout  price, rather than requiring the company or continuing owners to match  an outsider’s price. By requiring any and all departing owners to sell  out at the Agreement Price, you take a big step toward establishing a  reasonable value for the company for estate tax purposes. (Estate taxes  are the taxes that may be owed to the government upon a person’s death.) For more on this, see “How Buyout Agreements Affect Estate Taxes” in  Chapter 9.

   

   The options in our agreement that cover the price to be paid under a Right of First Refusal are shown below.

The price and terms in this  notice override the general Agreement Price selected in Section VI of  this agreement and the agreement terms selected in Section VII.

     If the proposed transfer is a gift of the owner’s interest, the company  and the nontransferring owners shall have the right to purchase the  interest of the transferring owner at the Agreement Price selected in  Section VI and according to the manner of payments and other terms of  the purchase as established in Section VII of this agreement.

The company and the nontransferring owners shall have the right to purchase the interest of the transferring owner at the Agreement Price selected  in Section VI and according to the manner of payments and other terms of the purchase as established in Section VII of this agreement.



Company vs. Co-Owners as Buyers

Our Right-of-First-Refusal clause provides that either the company or the  continuing owners can buy an owner’s interest to stop the transfer of  that interest.



In the case of a corporation, if the corporate entity, rather than the  continuing owners, buys an owner’s shares, it “cancels” them, which  means that the remaining owners’ percentages of ownership in the company increase accordingly. Similarly, in the case of partner- ships and  LLCs, if the company buys the departing owner’s interest, that interest  is “liquidated,” and the continuing partners’ or members’ ownership  percentages increase.

Compare this to the situation where the remaining shareholders, partners, or  LLC members decide to individually buy the transferring owner’s  interest. When this happens, the transferring owner’s interest is not  canceled or liquidated, but is reallocated among the remaining owners.



exAMpLe: Kate, Carmen, and Raisa own and operate a highly successful small,  member-managed LLC as equal one-third owners. Kate decides she wants to  leave the LLC and, because the company is so lucrative, finds a willing  buyer who signs a written offer to buy her LLC interest for cash. If the LLC, under the Right of First Refusal, buys back Kate’s interest,  Carmen and Raisa become equal one-half owners of the business after the  purchase. The same percentage result occurs if Carmen and Raisa both  decide to individually buy back one-half of Kate’s interest.



In Chapter 4, we discuss the procedure and issues (mainly tax advantages  and disadvantages) relating to who the buyer will be— the company or the continuing owners. For now, just understand that it’s best to use a  procedure that allows for either approach (ours

does), leaving the determination as to who should be the buyer to be made at the time of a buyout.



What a Right of First Refusal Doesn’t Do

If you think you may become interested in selling your interest later on,  it’s important to understand that a Right-of-First-Refusal provision  alone does not guarantee you’ll be able to sell your



interest—either to an outsider or to your co-owners. You may find it impossible to find a buyer who will make a legitimate offer for your interest at anything  but a flea market price, especially if you own

a minority interest. And if you can’t get an offer, you can’t trigger the Right-of-First-Refusal provision that allows the company or the  nontransferring owners to buy your interest. If you want a guarantee  that you’ll be able to cash out your interest, you’ll need to include

a Right-to-Force-Sale clause in your buy-sell agreement as well (discussed in Chapter 3).

The flip side of the coin is that a Right-of-First-Refusal provision may  not always be able to fulfill its main purpose—to give all owners the  ability to control the ownership of their company. Because of a lack of  company or personal funds, owners armed only with a  Right-of-First-Refusal provision may not be able to prevent a majority  owner from selling to a proposed buyer.

SEE AN ExPERT

check with your attorney. This is a good example of why minority owners should check with a small  business attorney to investigate the pros and cons of any  Right-of-First-Refusal provision before signing a buyout agreement.  Again, most of our advice is tailored to small businesses where the  owners own largely equal shares of the company. If you are a minority  owner, you’d be wise to have an attorney look over your agreement. We  cover finding expert help in Chapter 10.



Selling an Interest to a Current Owner

Many companies allow co-owners to transfer their interests among themselves  freely—without being subject to a Right-of-First-Refusal or other buyout provision. After all, a transfer to a current owner would not bring a  stranger into the ownership ranks—the current owners already share  management duties with each other.



The Problem

In situations where there are more than two owners, there’s another reason to establish rules governing interowner transfers: Without rules, there is no mechanism to prevent one or two co-owners

from grabbing control of the business by snapping up a transferring owner’s share. Here’s how this can happen:



exAMpLe: Serena, Petra, and Alexei start a small corporation that sells mailing lists,  with each owning 333 shares of the 999 shares that were initially  released. They do not create a

buyout agreement. After suffering through several management quarrels with  Petra, and deciding that the work is not personally meaningful to him,  Alexei decides he wants to cash out his interest and go to cooking  school. Needing a large chunk of change for tuition, he secretly  negotiates a deal with Serena, who agrees to buy his shares without  telling Petra, for whom Alexei and Serena have developed a general  distaste. The result is that Serena is able to purchase all of Alexei’s  interest without Petra’s knowing and ends up with a total of 666  shares—and control

of the company. Poor Petra no longer has a say in managing the company.



The Solution

To avoid situations where an equal owner suddenly and surprisingly becomes a majority owner, you can have your Right-of-First-Refusal clause apply to sales to current owners as well as outsiders. In other words,  whenever an owner’s interest is offered for sale to a current owner, *all* co-owners are given the opportunity to buy it first. The language that covers this choice in the agreement is shown below.

Transferring an Interest to a Trust

Gifting ownership interests and transferring them to trusts can be subject to  your buyout agreement, or not: You can make gifts of ownership interests and/or transfers to trusts subject to the same Right-of-First-Refusal  provision that sales are subject to, or you can exempt these types of  transfers, essentially giving owners free rein to give away their  ownership interests.

Let’s first take a brief look at why allowing owners the flexibility to  transfer their ownership interests freely may be important an important  part of estate planning to you and your co-owners.



The Problem

One aspect of estate planning is avoiding probate. Probate is a costly and  time-consuming court process during which a deceased person’s will is  proved authentic, all property subject to the will is inventoried and  appraised, and relatives and creditors are notified. Finally, the  property is distributed to the people entitled to inherit it. Probate  can take months or even years and can cost as much as 5% of the value of the probated property.

If the family members or business partners of a deceased owner have to  wait one or more years to gain title to their ownership interests from a probate court, business can grind to a halt. For this reason, keeping  ownership interests (and the voting power and management of the company) out of probate is essential to ensure the smooth transition of the  business.

Putting your ownership interest into a probate-avoidance living trust can avoid the hassles and costs of probate. Here’s how living trusts avoid  probate: When a business owner is at an age where estate planning  becomes necessary, he signs his ownership interest over to a legal  entity called a trust. The business owner is the trustee of the trust  and has control over the ownership interest, just as if he owned it in  his own name. Upon his death, the ownership interest

is transferred directly to the beneficiaries of the trust—usually the  owner’s spouse and/or children—without having to go through probate.

Another important aspect of estate planning is reducing or eliminating federal  estate taxes. The federal estate tax is a form of inheritance tax that  is taken from your estate after you die. Whatever property you leave  behind, including an ownership interest in a small business, might be  subject to federal estate taxes when you die. (See Chapter 9.)

Certain tax avoidance trusts, such as “AB” trusts, are a routine way for  couples to plan to reduce estate taxes. Buyout agreements may also be  able to lower estate taxes in limited circumstances. We discuss estate  taxes more fully, including whose estate may incur



them and several common methods of eliminating or lowering them, in “Estate Tax Issues” in Chapter 9.



The Solution

Because putting ownership interests in living trusts usually doesn’t threaten  the company or the continuing owners with an actual change of  ownership—it’s really just a paper transfer—many companies exempt from  the Right of First Refusal an owner’s transfer of his interest to a  trust, as long as the following conditions are met:

- The power to revoke (cancel) the trust remains with the owner of the business interest.
- The owner of the business interest is a trustee of the trust. If the owner ceases to be a trustee of the trust (for example,

a new trustee takes over because the owner becomes mentally

incompetent), the new trustee would control the owner’s interest and be able to vote  on the management of the company. Therefore, this change would be  considered an ownership transfer that causes the Right-of-First-Refusal  clause to kick in, giving the company and the other owners the right to  buy the interest back.

Our Right of First Refusal covers transfers to trusts in Subsection (e) of Option 1. It is shown below.

If you would like  them to be subject to the Right of First Refusal, make a note to do this on your worksheet.

1. This Right-of-First-Refusal clause shall not apply to an owner’s transfer of an ownership interest to a trust as long as the following conditions  are met:
   1. the power to revoke the trust remains with the grantor (the owner of the interest), and
   2. the grantor (the owner of the interest) is a trustee of the trust.

If either of the above conditions ceases to be true, this change will  subject the ownership interest to this Right-of- First-Refusal.



Making Gifts of Ownership Interests

The provision discussed just above, allowing transfers to living trusts,  does not address the matter of gifts—giving ownership interests to  relatives or long-term employees, usually to reduce eventual taxes

at death.

Making partial gifts of an ownership interest over time can be an integral  part of reducing estate taxes and avoiding probate. Giving away partial  interests to family members in $13,000 chunks each year is one method of reducing estate taxes and taking an ownership interest out of probate.  You can make an unlimited number of

$13,000 gifts (to different recipients) of cash or other property each calendar year, completely free of the estate or gift tax.



exAMpLe: Each year for the rest of your life you can give your son and your daughter each $13,000 (or something worth

$13,000), without incurring estate or gift taxes or eating into your personal  estate and gift tax exemption. Your spouse can also give $13,000 per  year to each child tax-free. (This would allow you to give away up to  $52,000 per year.) On top of that, both

of you can also make tax-exempt gifts to your children’s spouses and their children. This could allow you to gift another $52,000



(two spouses, but no grandchildren) to $156,000 per year (two spouses and  two grandchildren each). You can see how easy it can be to gift $100,000 to $200,000 per year, or a $1 million to

$2 million over 10 years.



The Problem

Most owners do not want their co-owners to be able to transfer their  interest to outsiders without any kind of oversight or approval  process—even if the outsiders in this case are children or other  relatives. The reasons for this are the same as for restricting any  transfer—mainly so that continuing owners don’t have to work with and  share control of the company with a new, untested owner.



The Solution

Our buyout agreement does not exempt gifts of ownership interests from the  Right-of-First-Refusal provision. Instead, the buyout agreement gives  the company and the continuing owners—those whose livelihood could be  affected by ownership changes—the discretion to allow or disallow gifts  of ownership interests. (If you and your co-owners have a different  perspective and wish to allow unrestricted gifts of ownership interests, see “Allowing Unrestricted Gifts of Ownership Interests,” below.)

Our Right-of-First-Refusal clause works with respect to proposed gifts in  almost the same way as it does for proposed sales. Before giving part or all of her interest away, the owner who is considering giving a gift of her interest (the transferring owner) must give written notice to the  company of the proposed transfer, including the proposed recipient’s  name and address. (However, the gifts provision says that in this case  the price and terms at which the company or the nontransferring owners  can purchase the interest are the standard Agreement Price and payment  terms established elsewhere in the buyout agreement.)

If the company and the other owners decline to purchase the ownership  interest, the transferring owner is free to give away her interest. But  if the company or other owners decide they don’t



want the transfer to go through, they must pay the owner for the interest  according to the price and terms in the agreement. Keep in mind that if  the company or the nontransferring owners buy the

interest, the transferring owner will have cash available from her sale proceeds  that she is free to give away to relatives for estate planning purposes.

older business owners may want the ability to freely plan their



estates. Owners with estate planning concerns may need more freedom to avoid probate  and estate taxes by gifting partial ownership interests. They should be  aware of how a buyout agreement can hinder an owner’s individual estate  plan. (As discussed above, giving away part of your ownership interest  to family members in $13,000 chunks each year is an important method

of reducing estate taxes and taking the ownership interest out of probate. To allow this type of gifting, see “Allowing Unrestricted gifts of  Ownership Interests,” below.) If you are of an age where estate planning is high up on your to-do list, you should have your estate planner look over your buyout agreement before you sign it, to make sure it won’t  conflict with your estate planning goals.

Of course, remember that in allowing the unchecked gifting of  ownership interests, owners give up some of their collective control  over the ownership of the company. The option from our agreement is  shown below.

Using Absolute Transfer Restrictions

Just saying “no” to the possibility of all ownership transfers, including  gifts and sales to outsiders and current owners, is another way that  owners can keep control of company ownership. But

we don’t recommend this all-or-nothing approach. Not only is it  inflexible, but it also doesn’t reasonably balance the needs of an  individual owner who wants or needs to transfer ownership with those of  the continuing owners who want to stay.

A complete ban on the transfer of ownership interests would prevent any  owner from selling, gifting, or otherwise transferring her interest  (unless, of course, her co-owners agree to change or ignore the ban  later).

A similar clause that can have the same effect—called No Transfers Without Consent—would require an owner to get the



approval of her co-owners before selling her interest to an outsider, gifting it to relatives, or making other transfers. No question, either of these  provisions gives a huge amount of power to the other owners; they really can “just say no” to the owner who wants to sell, without even having  to buy his interest. (At least with the Right-of- First-Refusal clause,  discussed above, the continuing owners have to fork out some cash to  stop a transfer, meaning it’s less likely they’ll disallow a sale on a  whim.) One nasty result of a No-Transfers- Without-Consent clause may be that the majority owners withhold their consent to a sale and then  pressure a minority owner to sell his ownership interest to the company  or to them at an unfairly

low price.

- no transfers Without consent

No owner shall sell, transfer, or in any way dispose of any of his or her  ownership interest or any right or interest in the company without  obtaining prior written consent of the company and of all other owners.



Here’s an example of what such a clause would look like.







A restriction that provides a little more flexibility is a clause that  provides for Transfers to Qualified Buyers Only. Here, transfers to  certain qualified buyers are allowed, and you and your co-owners have  the opportunity to define the term “qualified buyer” in advance in your  buyout agreement. For example, your agreement could require a potential  buyer to hold a license for a particular profession or have a certain  number of years of experience in your particular field.

While this restriction protects the nontransferring owners from having to  share management with an obviously unqualified person, most business  owners feel that it doesn’t offer them adequate protection since it  doesn’t give them a way to stop a sale to a new owner for other reasons.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_028.png)



- transfers to Qualified Buyers only

No owner shall sell, transfer, or in any way dispose of any of his or her  ownership interest or any right or interest in the company except to a  buyer or other proposed transferee who has [insert qualifications, such as “five years’ full-time experience in selling real estate”].



Here’s an example of what such a clause would look like.







The opposite of this restriction is a No-Transfers-to-Certain- Persons  clause. Typical uses of this type of provision would be to prohibit a  sale to a competitor, to any existing owner who would then own a  greater-than-50% ownership interest, or to any buyer whose purchase  would jeopardize a key tax election or violate state law. For example,  if your company is an S corporation, you may prohibit a sale to a  non-U.S. citizen, a corporation, an LLC, or a partnership, all of whose  ownership would terminate S corporation tax treatment. This type of  restriction is normally legal as long as you do not prohibit transfers  to outsiders based on discriminatory criteria such as a buyer’s race or  sex.

CAUTION

These transfer restrictions are not included in our buyout



agreement. Since we remain unconvinced that these clauses provide flexible and  intelligent solutions for controlling the ownership of small companies,  we do not include the three transfer restrictions discussed above in our

agreement. (We believe the Right-of-First-Refusal clause does a balanced job of  restricting ownership in most cases.) In addition, in at least some  states, courts have refused to enforce such strict prohibitions on the  sale of ownership interests. If you are nevertheless interested in using one of the clauses, get the advice of a small business lawyer or other  expert before you do so. We cover finding expert help in Chapter 10. ●

## o



ver the course of its business life, your company will probably experience a few bumps in the road, and maybe even a pothole or two. Many of the  unwelcome

jounces will involve the business itself, such as problems with sales,  employees, or product quality. But often the most troublesome shocks  will occur when an owner’s personal situation changes. In this chapter  we look at some of the common life changes that can upset any business,  and we discuss ways your buyout agreement can be structured to cope with such predictable upheaval.



Changes in an Owner’s Circumstances

In Chapter 2, we discussed how a buyout agreement can control or prevent  an owner from selling, giving away, or otherwise transferring an  ownership interest. In this chapter, we discuss how a buyout agreement  can regulate the transfer of ownership when certain events occur that  can upset the functioning of a closely managed company. These events  typically include the retirement, disability, divorce, bankruptcy, or  death of an owner.



The Problem

Changes in one owner’s circumstances will affect the business as a whole. For  example, what will happen if an owner becomes disabled or loses his  needed vocational license? Or, what if the owner

retires from active work or simply wants to leave the company? The fortunes of  all owners of the company will no doubt be affected.

Other events, like an owner’s divorce, death, or personal bankruptcy can  cause the owner’s business interest to be transferred to an outsider.  These events can be traumatic, for both the affected owner and the  company as a whole. For instance, if an owner gets divorced, the  ex-spouse might receive half of an ownership interest as part of the  divorce settlement, or, if an owner files for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee might take over the ownership interest.



Or, if you are the owner who wants to leave the company or can no longer  actively work in the company, you’ll no doubt want a way to convert your ownership interest to cash.

Sometimes these changes or buyouts are handled in a collegial fashion even  without a buyout agreement, with the company or continuing co-owners  simply agreeing to buy out the share of the departing owner (or his  estate), and the departing owner (or his estate) agreeing to sell out at a fair price. But it’s more common that co-owners, or the company and a deceased co-owner’s family members, don’t see eye to eye. For example, a retiring owner, an inheriting son, or an ex-spouse who receives a  partial ownership

interest during divorce may demand a price for the ownership interest that is much higher than its market value.

Bickering over the terms of a buyout, or even whether one should occur, can use  up a lot of the company’s important time and, should lawyers become  involved, money. Such disputes can also weaken bonds between ongoing  owners and even lead to the failure of a company. In these cases and  others like them, a lot of grief can be avoided if the owners can simply turn to their buyout agreement to force a buyout at a preestablished  price.



The Solution

When a disruption occurs, the company or the continuing co- owners usually  want to readjust the ownership of the company to restore it to something closer to what it was before the change in circumstances upset the  status quo. For instance, in the case where an ownership interest is  transferred to an ex-spouse or a bankruptcy trustee, the company or  co-owners will no doubt want the right to buy back that interest, to be  able to restore control to the original owners of the company.

Similarly, should an owner no longer be able to work, perhaps because he has  become disabled, lost his license, or retired early, the company or  continuing co-owners will probably want the right to



buy out his interest, to keep control of the company in the hands of active owners.

In these situations, your buyout agreement can allow the company and  continuing owners to force a departing owner to sell out. This option,  called an “Option to Purchase an Owner’s Interest,” gives your company  and its owners the right to purchase an ownership interest from an owner or her estate or her family members. Here, the company and the  continuing owners have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase  all or part of a departing

owner’s interest within a certain time period, at the price and terms that are preestablished in the buyout agreement.

On the other hand, if you are the owner who wants to leave the company or  can no longer actively work in the company, you will probably want to be able to force the company or your co-owners to buy you out. (We look at the pros and cons of this for each circumstance—retirement, death,  divorce, disability—below.) In any of these cases, your buyout agreement can allow a departing owner to force a buyout by the company or the  continuing owners—called a “Right to Force a Sale.” This option *requires* the company or its owners to buy out an ownership interest from an owner or her

family members, if the departing owner or her family members make the request. When the departing owner demands that the company or the continuing  owners buy his ownership interest, within a certain time period the  company or the continuing owners must purchase the departing owner’s  interest, at the price and terms that are preestablished in the  agreement.

Our forced buyout provisions provide that, in any potential buyout  situation, either the company or the continuing owners may buy a  departing owner’s interest. In Chapter 4, we discuss the procedure for  deciding who the buyer will be: the company or the continuing owners. We also discuss the pros and cons—mainly tax advantages and  disadvantages—that will affect that decision. For now, just understand  that it’s a determination that will be made at the time of a buyout by  the company and the continuing owners.

Advice for Majority Owners

Most of our advice is aimed at companies that were started by several people owning roughly equal percentages. But when a majority owner runs the  business along with one or more small minority owners, things change a  bit. A majority owner may not want to be subject to the same  restrictions that the minority owners are subject to. And, indeed, there is no rule that says all owners must be treated alike in a buyout  agreement (except when used to minimize estate taxes—we discuss special  require- ments of buyout agreements regarding estate taxes in “Estate  Tax Issues” in Chapter 9).

For instance, a majority owner may want her children, but not the minority  owners’ children, to be able to take over the business after her death.  In that case, she wouldn’t want the company or the remaining owners to  be able to force her children to sell their interest subject to an  Option-to-Purchase provision. (We discuss this scenario in “If an Owner  Dies,” below.)

If you are a majority owner and don’t want to be restricted under a  certain provision, you can add a sentence at the end of any forced

buyout provision saying: “This section applies only to owners of less than 50% of the interests in the company.” (Note that if you do this, your  agreement cannot set the value of the ownership interests for estate tax purposes. We discuss setting the value for estate tax purposes in  “Estate Tax Issues” in Chapter 9.)

As a majority owner, you might also want to consult a small business  lawyer before signing a buy-sell agreement to ensure that you don’t give up important elements of control unintentionally and unnecessarily.



Common Scenarios

While all sorts of specific events can trigger or call for a change in the  ownership of a company, a few broad scenarios are most likely to affect  small businesses. In the rest of this chapter, we consider the most  common types of business-disrupting events, discuss the various  ownership transition issues that arise with each one, and present the  ways to provide for forced buyouts.

Of course, as you read this material, you’ll want to think about the  ownership transition problems that are most likely to occur in your  company. Then, as you prepare your buyout agreement, you’ll want to be  sure you address not only the several types of ownership transition  problems likely to be faced by lots of small businesses, but also the  specific issues that concern you. Remember, you can include any or all  of our clauses and options as is, or custom tailor them to fit your  situation. Now let’s jump into the scenarios that can cause business  disruptions, and discuss possible solutions for each.



If an Owner Retires or Stops Working

At a time when some people hope to retire early and others want to work  well past middle age but will change fields several times over their  lifetime, it’s common for an owner to retire, move on, or simply stop  working for your company. A buyout agreement can both protect the  continuity of the company and advance the departing owner’s exit  strategy.



Option to Purchase a Departing Owner’s Interest

Most, but not all, of the time, an owner who wants to leave will also want to take his marbles (cash) with him—usually by having the company or the  continuing owners buy out his interest.



The Problem

Sometimes an active owner (as opposed to a passive investor) who wants to retire  or stop working for the company will want to retain all or part of his  ownership stake. In some situations this may be just what the continuing owners want, since this allows them to keep the departing owner’s  capital in the business; they don’t have to come up with money for a  buyout. But in other situations, the remaining owners may not like this  arrangement, reasoning that they don’t want a passive investor to reap  the benefits of their continuing hard work to increase the value of the  company.

Consider what might happen if a departing owner stops working for your business  under less-than-amicable circumstances and is poised to make trouble for management. Even if circumstances are initially friendly, tensions may  eventually arise between the active owners, who may be working long  hours to build up the company, and an inactive owner, who may still want to have a say in things and retain her right to a share of the profits.



exAMpLe: Andromache and Eddie leave their management positions at a large software company  to form a small custom- programming shop (Scripts Are Us). They convince a programmer, Mark, to work with them by offering him a minority  interest in the new company. After two years, during which Scripts Are  Us is modestly successful, Mark and the majority owners no longer see  eye to eye on product development issues. As a result, Mark quits to  follow his own dreams.

In the absence of a buyout agreement, Mark can—and does—refuse to sell his minority interest to Andromache and Eddie, apparently believing that  even though they are not as farsighted as he is, Scripts Are Us is  likely to enjoy a profitable future. Unfortunately, Mark doesn’t go  quietly

into the night. Instead, Mark’s continual kibitzing becomes a constant  annoyance to Andromache and Eddie, who particularly resent his periodic  demands to inspect the company’s books.

Finally, after several nasty spats at shareholders meetings



over the reinvestment of profits, Mark brings a lawsuit against Andromache  and Eddie, claiming they have breached their “fiduciary duty to him as a minority shareholder.”

No question that Andromache, Eddie, and Mark would have been far better  off if, at the time their business was formed, they’d adopted a buyout  agreement covering the eventuality that one of them might cease to be  active in the business.



One thing is sure, it’s hard to know how one owner’s deciding to retire or  quit will be viewed in the future. A lot will probably depend on whether the departing owner and the remaining owners are on good personal  terms. But just because you can’t predict the

future doesn’t mean you shouldn’t prepare for it by providing options in the buyout agreement.



The Solution

On balance it’s usually best to provide that when an owner quits her  active duties, whether as an officer or employee, the company and the  continuing owners have the *option* to purchase that owner’s  interest—in other words, to force the departing owner to sell them the  ownership interest. Such a provision doesn’t *obligate* the company or the continuing owners to purchase the departing owner’s interest,  but it gives them the option to decide what to do in the future. Our  agreement allows the company and continuing owners to buy any or all of  the departing owner’s interest. For example, if the company and  continuing owners can afford to buy only half of the departing owner’s  interest, they can do so.

We include a clause that provides for this in our buyout agreement.

It’s called an “Option to Purchase” clause, and it is shown below.

   CAUTION

   not for silent investors. If your company is owned by both inactive, “silent” investors and actively participating owners, this buyout option may not suit your needs. (If  an investor was not working in the first place, retirement should not  change his situation with regard to the company.)

   Since most of our advice is tailored to small businesses where the owners are active in the business, we don’t deal in detail with the special needs  (or problems) of “silent” investors. If you face this situation, be sure to have an

   attorney look over your agreement. We cover finding expert help in Chapter 10.

   

   Right of Departing Owner to Force a Sale

   Rather than having trouble forcing a departing owner to sell out, it’s far  more likely that, when a co-owner decides to leave a business, she’ll be anxious to sell her interest, either to an outsider or back to the  company or the continuing owners. Assuming she has no luck finding an  outsider to buy her interest, she’ll probably approach the company and  the continuing owners.

   In this situation, the question often becomes: Can departing owners force  the continuing owners to purchase their share of the business? As you’ve probably guessed, the answer is: not unless there is an agreement  requiring it.

   In the absence of an agreement, sometimes the company or the continuing owners will be happy to buy the departing owner

   out—perhaps the company is now quite profitable and the remaining owners will be  pleased to increase their shares. Or, perhaps the departing owner is  leaving precisely because she wasn’t getting along with the other owners and they’re glad to see her go, even if

   it means they have to pay her for her share of the company. In these and  other workable circumstances, an ownership buyout is normally a fairly  straightforward situation. Once the deal is done, it’s business as usual with one less owner.

   

   The Problem

   It’s not always so simple. What if the remaining owners don’t want to, or  can’t afford to, buy a departing partner out? Before you adopt a buyout  provision that will deal with this situation, you and your co-owners  should ask yourselves a simple question: Do you want an owner (who,  after all, could be any of you) to be able to force the company and the  continuing owners to buy her interest if she decides to leave?

   Especially if you’re a minority owner, your answer is likely to be yes. It can be  hard enough to sell a majority interest in a small

   business, but it can be next to impossible to sell a minority stake—or even a 50% share.

   

   exAMpLe: Luis and Marta are equal partners in a successful burrito shop that caters  to the business lunch crowd. After a few years of long hours and hard  work, Marta decides she wants

   to sell her interest to Luis and get a job where she can work shorter  hours and spend more time with her kids. Luis, who feels personally  abandoned, is reluctant to further stretch his already tight finances  and is worried about competition from a new deli that is about to open  in the area. He shrugs and says he’s not interested in buying Marta’s  interest. Since she and Luis didn’t sign a buyout agreement, Marta has  to search for an outside buyer. She hires a business broker and spends  money advertising, but finds out that no one wants to buy only half of a burrito shop. Potential buyers want the whole enchilada or

   nothing. After looking for a buyer for months, Marta finally ends up selling her share to Luis’s cousin for far less than it was worth.

   

   To avoid this, departing owners can be allowed to force a buyback of their interests. But this does give owners full leeway in deciding if and  when to leave the business. Personal flexibility may not necessarily be a good thing for your company or for the owners who are left behind when  one owner quits. Leaving aside the fact that it may weaken all owners’  commitment to their company, it creates the real possibility that one or more owners will demand

   to be cashed out precisely at a time when the company is doing poorly or  needs every bit of its cash for another purpose, such as expansion.

   Recognizing that a forced buyout may be highly problematic, you may decide to head  in the opposite direction and say that a departing owner can never force the company or other owners to buy him out. But, of course, that brings you right back to the worry you started with: the possibility of  getting stuck forever owning a share of a business you no longer want,  or selling your share at a huge discount because you’re so desperate to  get out. This prospect is so unattractive—and potentially unfair—that it can lead to horrendous results.

   

   exAMpLe: Dakon and Jed each contribute $20,000 of their savings to open a climbing  gear store in Colorado. To purchase inventory and cover other start-up  costs, they also take out a bank loan. From the start, they are  successful enough to pay the bills and eke out small salaries, but not  much else. Near the end of the first year, Dakon tells Jed he wants out  of the business and would like his $20,000 back—running a business, it  turns out, doesn’t give him enough time to hit the peaks. Jed can’t  figure out a way to give Dakon his investment back without selling off  badly needed inventory at fire sale prices (and perhaps having to close  the shop). Refusing to do this, he tells Dakon that he can’t take his  money out of the business so soon and on such short notice. This angers  Dakon—after all, he has worked hard at low pay for almost a year! So one night Dakon grabs what he guesses is $20,000 worth of climbing gear  from the store, loads it into

   his Jeep and takes off. On the counter he leaves a note saying that the  store now belongs 100% to Jed. Left with inadequate inventory, Jed can’t pay the store’s debts and has to file for bankruptcy. Of course, Jed  may have a claim against Dakon, but with Dakon off climbing mountains in Chile, Jed is unlikely to collect anything.

   

   The Solution

   One way to deal with this situation is to include a buyout provision that  requires either the company or its remaining owners to buy out an owner  who wants to leave. This type of clause—we call it

   a “Right-to-Force-a-Sale” clause—can protect a departing co-owner (who,  after all, might be leaving as the result of personal or financial  distress) by guaranteeing a buyer for his ownership interest.

   The financial effects of a required buyout on the company can be buffered  by providing disincentives to leaving early, by requiring advance notice of a departure, and by using installment plans. This way an owner who  leaves prematurely can get back at least some of his investment, without bankrupting the company.

   

   Financial disincentives. Your Right-to-Force-a-Sale clause can require the company to buy out an  owner at full price only when he has been an active owner in the company two or three years or more. If the owner leaves before the expiration  of the required

   time period, the company will be required to buy him out only at a  discounted price (say, 50% of the business’s appraised value). This  makes it clear to the owners that, by going into business, they are  making a financial commitment to stick it out until the business becomes profitable—if they don’t, they may lose all or part of their  investment.

   

   exAMpLe: Let’s rewind our cameras and give Jed and Dakon a legal framework designed to cope with change. Knowing that Dakon is highly susceptible to the call  of the wild, early on Jed raises the subject of what would happen if one of them becomes unhappy with the business and wants out. They jointly  decide that to get the business past its start-up pains, each must make

   a minimum two-year commitment. To enforce this point, they adopt a buyout provision stating that if one of them decides to leave during the first year, the other will buy him out at a price that is 40% of the standard buyout price set in the agreement (the “Agreement Price,” discussed in  Chapter 6). If one of them leaves during year two, he will get 60% of  the Agreement Price. Only if a co-owner stays with the business into the third year is he eligible to force a purchase at 100% of the full  Agreement Price.

   The good news is that Dakon, realizing he is committed, hangs in for almost three years, at which point Jed has no trouble borrowing part of the  money to buy Dakon’s share for 100% of the Agreement Price; the rest he  pays Dakon in installments over three years.

   TIP

   choosing the required time period. The length of time you

   

   require for a departing owner to receive 100% of the Agreement Price can vary  with your type of business. For example, if yours is the type of  business that requires a high initial investment and is likely to take  four or more years to fully establish, you may want to pay a departing  owner 100% of her interest’s value only after four years.

   

   There are, of course, times when an owner really needs to leave and be cashed out, as opposed to simply wanting to bail out to do something else. For example, an owner with a sick child may need to move closer to a  particular medical center, or an owner whose own health is declining may be advised to quit working. In situations like these, should the  departing owner be subject to the same penalty discounts that would  apply to an owner who leaves

   his spouse and runs off to the Cayman Islands? If your answer is no, you  can provide that an owner who leaves for a short list of personal or  family reasons is entitled to a better deal than an owner who leaves on a whim.

   

   exAMpLe: Let’s rewind one more time. Dakon and Jed are running their climbing gear  business with a solid buyout agreement in place that outlines what will  happen if one of them leaves the business. Dakon learns that his elderly mother has severe multiple sclerosis. He decides he has to move back  east

   1. When an owner voluntarily retires or quits the company’s employ, he or she  can require the company and the continuing owners to buy all, but not  less than all, of his or her ownership interest by delivering to the  company at least 60 days before his or her departure a notice of  intention to force a sale (“Notice of Intent to Force a Sale”). The  notice shall include the date of departure, the name and address of the  owner, a description and amount of the owner’s interest in the company  and a statement that the owner wishes to force a sale due to the owner’s retirement as provided in this provision. The procedure for purchase of the ownership interest shall be according to Section IV, Provision 2 of this agreement. The price to be paid, the manner of payments and other  terms of the purchase shall be according to this section and Sections VI and VII of this agreement. An owner

   who requests that his interest be purchased is referred to as a “retiring owner” below.

   

   departing owner can request only that the company and continuing owners buy all of her interest or none of it.

payment plans. Allowing a flexible payment plan, such as an installment plan, is another way to allow the company (or the continuing owners) to buy out a departing  owner without

threatening the survival of the company. In fact, a lengthy payment can even allow  the company to pay a departing owner a higher price. You may be  wondering how Jed could afford to pay Dakon 100% of the Agreement Price  after being in business less than a year. The best way to accomplish a  sudden buyout without bankrupting the business is to pay a departing  owner in installments over several years. We cover payment plan options  in Chapter 7.

When a death or disability is involved, planning to fund a buyout with  insurance is also an option. We cover insurance funding in Chapter 5.

CAUTION

Get released from personally guaranteed loans. When an owner



leaves the company, he should attempt to get released from loans that he has  personally guaranteed. However, it may not be easy to get a bank to  release the owner from a loan. In that case, the owner should insist the loan be paid off and a new loan taken out by the continuing owners, if  necessary.



Advance notice. Another smart way to ease the burden of a forced buyout is to require an owner  who wants to quit or retire to give the company advance notice of her  intention to leave (except in the case of death or sudden illness or  disability, of course). In some companies, requiring as much as a six-  to twelve-month advance notice is often considered reasonable. Our  agreement requires a

1. day notice. This hopefully will give the remaining owners some time to take a collective deep breath and devise a plan to buy out the owner and  continue the business. Of course, if you and your business partners  think you’ll need more notice, you can change the agreement to reflect  this.

   Be Ready to Customize Standard Clauses to Fit Your Situation

   Throughout this book we provide options and technical language to solve common  buyout situations. But because every situation contains its own nuances, you may want to tinker with our clauses and clause options to be sure  your agreement fits like a custom-made glove, not a one-size-fits-all  handcuff. For instance, as noted in the text, a well-drawn buyout  agreement will balance the desire to protect each owner in case of  personal problems with the need to protect the financial integrity of  the business. We’ve talked about several ways to approach this balance.  But only you and your co-owners know what’s best for your company.

   If you want to provide a market for a departing owner without  overburdening the company and aren’t satisfied with the options we  suggest, such as requiring advance notice, financial disincentives, and a payment plan, you can create your own contractual language. For  example, a customized Right-to-Force-a-Sale provision might state

   that the departing owner must first try to find an outside buyer who is  acceptable to the other owners. Assuming no buyer comes forward after  six months, your agreement could then provide that the company or the  continuing owners must purchase the departing owner’s interest at

   40% of the full Agreement Price. This discount gives the departing owner  some incentive to find an outside buyer first and lessens the immediate  financial burden on the company and remaining owners.

   If an Owner Becomes Disabled

   The next business-disrupting event we help you plan for is the possibility  that an owner becomes disabled. Disability, of course, includes physical injuries and illnesses, but also can be caused by mental illness, such  as clinical depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and other forms of dementia or incapacity.

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_044.png)

   TIP

   Look at disability and retirement buyout clauses together. If

   

   an owner feels he cannot work and wants to be bought out, but does not fit under a doctor’s or the disability insurance company’s definition of  disability, arguments can arise. These conflicts can often be defused in advance if you have also adopted a clause allowing an owner to force a  sale due to retirement (discussed above in “If an Owner Retires or Stops Working”).

   

   Option to Purchase a Disabled Owner’s Interest

   Have you considered what would happen if an owner were to develop a chronic  illness, become injured, or otherwise be unable to participate in  company affairs for an extended period of time? If the owner is an  investor and was never involved in the day-

   to-day operations of the business, the answer may appropriately be  “nothing”—after all, it probably makes little difference to the company  whether an inactive, silent investor is or isn’t disabled.

   But for our purposes, let’s assume the owner has been active in the business and takes a salary or regular draws from it.

   

   The Problem

   There are obvious reasons why co-owners might sooner or later want to replace a disabled owner who can no longer work but takes money out of the  company. Of course, after a decent interval the

   co-owners could stop the salary of the disabled owner (who, after all, is no  longer earning it), but allow him to continue to own his share of the  business. (For partnership or LLCs, where the owner automatically draws a percentage of profits from the company, this may entail a change to the partnership agreement or LLC operating agreement, which the disabled  owner might have to agree to.)

   However, the co-owners of a small company may not want to share future successes and management decisions with an owner who is no longer adding anything to the company. In this situation, the co-owners might want the right  to buy out the disabled owner.

   Absent this right, there can be highly emotional disagreements when a disabled owner does not want to be bought out (he may even disagree as to  whether he is unable to perform his duties). It is because of the  debilitating nature of these disputes that you need to have a  disability-triggered buyout provision in place.

   

   exAMpLe: George has been a partner of a printing company for ten years, along with his  longtime friends Faiza and Ali. Now in his 70s, he frequently  experiences significant lapses of memory. More than once his  forgetfulness has led to an unfinished job, and unhappy clients have  begun to whisper to Faiza and Ali that they no longer want to work with  George. George admits he is sometimes forgetful, but he insists that he  is fit to continue working. But when they almost lose their biggest  client, Ali and Faiza face the truth that George is not mentally up to  continuing to work. Since George is a general partner entitled to an  annual share of the company profits, the only sensible way to stop him

   from receiving one-third of the company’s profits is to ask him to sell out. But when confronted by Ali and Faiza, George refuses, threatening to  get a lawyer. Faiza and Ali rue the day, ten years before, when they  didn’t insist on a buy-sell agreement dealing with disability as a  condition of starting the business.

   

   The Solution

   Your agreement can include a clause that allows the company and the other  owners to require a disabled owner (or the owner’s conservator,  guardian, or other legal representative) to sell the ownership interest  back to the company or to the other owners on demand. This protects the  continuing owners of the company

   from having to share management with someone who can’t handle the  requirements of the job, or simply from having to support that person.

   Before you decide to adopt a disability provision, you’ll want to ask two questions:

   - Will the continuing owners be able to come up with the money to fund the buyout?
   - Who will determine whether the owner is truly disabled?

Funding. Most small to mid-sized businesses need every penny they can scare up to  maintain or expand their business—they don’t have a ready store of cash  to fund a buyout. One way to cope with this problem is to call for a  long-term installment plan, allowing the company or continuing owners to make partial payments to a disabled owner over a number of years.

But for larger companies, especially, there is a better way to cope with  this issue that doesn’t make the disabled owner wait many years to be  paid off for her interest. Your buy-sell agreement can require the  purchase of disability insurance for all co-owners. This way, if a  disability occurs, the insurance policy proceeds will provide a source  of funds to allow the company or the co-owners to buy back the interest  of a disabled owner without diminishing company or personal cash  reserves.

If desired, additional financial benefits such as a wage continu- ation  plan for the disabled owner can also be funded by disability policy  proceeds. (We discuss using insurance to fund your agree- ment in more  detail in Chapter 5.)

defining disabled. A big issue you’ll have to face is when an owner is truly disabled. Does the owner decide when she can no



longer work? Does the owner have to be unable to work for a few weeks? A few months? What if the owner gets better?

Our agreement specifies that the owner must be “permanently and totally  disabled”—that is, unable to perform most or all of his duties for the  foreseeable future. Our agreement also includes a procedure to determine when an owner is considered disabled—by using the opinion of the  owner’s doctor. Note: If you intend to fund a future disability buyout  with disability insurance (discussed in Chapter 5), our agreement  provides that the insurance company will

be the arbiter of whether the co-owner really is disabled. (An added bonus of going that route is that the other owners will be relieved of the  burden of supervising the disability claim and asking the disabled owner for medical evidence of a disability.)

There are several additional issues you should consider to ensure that your  disability clause has the maximum chance of working well:

- Waiting period. You should agree on a period of time—a waiting period (or, in insurance  lingo, an elimination period)—over which an owner’s disability must  persist before a buyout can occur. This allows for the fact that the  owner might recover. We recommend that your waiting period be at least  six months, or perhaps as long as a year. A buyout attempted before it’s really clear that the owner probably won’t recover can result in  bitterness and wasted time and money if the former owner recovers in a  short period of time.

  Our agreement also provides that time spent off work by an owner with a  series of illnesses with the same or related causes can be added up to  fulfill the waiting period requirement. Otherwise, requiring a period of *continuous*

  inability to work might discourage an injured or ill individual from returning to work if he’s feeling better (perhaps to test whether going back to work would be feasible). Of course,

  if your agreement will require the purchase of a disability insurance policy to fund the agreement, your waiting period

  

  should coincide with the elimination period in the disability insurance policy.

  - date of valuation. You should decide when the value of the company will be determined for the  purpose of a disability buyout. Your agreement specifies how the buyout  price will be determined—the value of the disabled owner’s

interest is determined using the standard buyout price—this follows the same  formula used if the co-owner quits, dies, or retires (this set price or  formula is called the “Agreement Price,” discussed in Chapter 6).  However, “when” the price is determined is usually addressed as a  separate issue in the disability provision. Here’s why: There may be a  significant difference in the worth of the company in between the date

the owner became unable to work and the date the disability waiting period  is over. Most companies use the date the owner stopped working as the  date to value the business— since that is the date the owner stopped  contributing to

the company. This way, any changes in the worth of the company can be attributed to the remaining owners.

The disability provision included in our buy-sell agreement, which allows  you to insert a waiting period and choose the date that disability is  established, is shown below.

Right of Disabled Owner to Force a Sale

You may have noticed that we haven’t mentioned the needs of the disabled owner himself.



The Problem

It’s possible that a situation may arise where an owner becomes unable to  work but the other owners don’t jump to buy out the disabled owner, most likely because they don’t have the necessary funds. In this situation, a disabled owner whose salary is discontinued and who does not  automatically draw a percentage of profits from the company will  probably be anxious to be bought out. (And even if the disabled owner  remains entitled to a percentage of profits after she stops working,  that draw will no doubt decrease, as the profits of a small company will likely drop soon after one of the owners stops working for it.)



exAMpLe: Steve is a 10% owner and employee of FastShip, Inc., a small, family-run  freight-forwarding corporation, where all owners participate in the  heavy lifting from time to time. After he injures his back lifting  boxes, Steve’s doctor says he can no longer work, so he stops getting a  paycheck. (Steve, as an owner, is not entitled to workers’ compensation  benefits, and FastShip, like many corporations, doesn’t pay stock  dividends. With the exception of a small weekly disability payment,  Steve’s income

is now zero.) Short of cash, Steve asks his co-owners to buy him out.  While sympathetic, the other owners had just made a personal loan to the business (which has been struggling) to purchase new timesaving  electrical lifting equipment. They tell Steve that neither they nor the  company itself can afford to buy Steve out for at least two years. Steve can’t find an outside buyer for his shares and is stuck keeping an  interest in a company that produces no dividends and that he can no  longer work for.



To avoid being locked into a business in whose profits they can no longer participate or depend on, many owners want an



exit strategy: a buyout provision that guarantees a buyer for their ownership interest in case they become disabled.



The Solution

Steve, from the above example, would have been much better off if he and the other owners had created a buyout agreement at the

outset that required the company or co-owners to buy out a disabled owner,  using policy proceeds from mandatory disability insurance.

Fortunately, your buyout agreement can do this with a Right-to- Force-a-Sale clause  that’s very similar to the “Option to Purchase a Disabled Owner’s  Interest” clause we just discussed above. This provision provides some  security for a disabled owner who no longer works for the company.

The Right-to-Force-a-Sale disability provision in our buyout agreement is  shown below. Note that this provision does not allow a disabled owner to require the company or the continuing owners

to buy just a portion of his ownership interest. A disabled owner can  request only that the company and continuing owners buy all of her  interest.

   TIP

   possible overlap between clauses is not a problem. A disabled

   

   owner may, of course, decide to retire. Thus, there could be situations  where, if you include in your buy-sell agreement a Right-to-Force-a-Sale clause for both departing owners and disabled owners, a disabled owner  could use either provision. Which one would he use? Undoubtedly,  whichever clause has more generous terms. It follows that if you decide  to include one or more

   buyout clauses, you’ll want to be sure they fit well together. For instance,  many companies choose to give the company and continuing owners an  option

   to purchase a departing owner’s interest; give a disabled owner the right  to force a sale; and allow a departing owner to force a sale only if the owner has worked for the company for a minimum number of years.

   

   If an Owner Dies

   Do not skip this section. Even if you and your co-owners are all young and in radiant health, it’s crucial to deal with the possibility that one  of you will die. What happens in case of an owner’s death may be the  most important scenario you can include in your buyout agreement.

   The death of a co-owner, especially one who is an active manager or worker, is sure to be extremely traumatic for your business, both emotionally  and economically. First, you will lose the services of a central player  and worker (and probably a friend). And if the owner

   

   was someone your customers highly regarded (common in a service business),  you’ll face the real possibility of a business meltdown.

   And, even if you keep your business together, you’ll need to cope with the  fundamental fact that someone else will have control over your former  co-owner’s interest after her death.

   This raises a key question: Who will own the deceased owner’s share? Right  after an owner’s death, her interest will be part of her estate (along  with all other property she owned at death). If the deceased co-owner  left her business interest to an inheritor under the terms of a will, a  personal representative or executor (named by the will or by the court)  will manage the estate through a lengthy probate process before it is  eventually transferred to the inheritor. If the owner put the interest  into a probate-avoiding living trust before she died, the interest will  be promptly transferred to whoever is named to receive it in the trust  (absent a buy-sell agreement).

   RELATED TOPIC

   Interested in trusts? Probate-avoidance living trusts are discussed in “Transferring an Interest to a Trust” in Chapter 2.

   

   Business succession. Whether an owner of a small business leaves her interest by will or is wise  enough to use a probate-avoiding living trust, the end result is that  the surviving owners are faced with the specter of sharing management  duties and profits of the company with new owners—the inheritors of the  deceased owner’s interest. If the deceased owner was married or had  children, the inheritors would likely be his spouse and children. If  not, the inher- itors would likely be his parents, or possibly a  domestic partner.

   These people may be inexperienced, uninterested, immature, or even destructive—or they may be a perfect fit for the company.

   Surviving owners who find themselves in this situation have several options. They can:

   - welcome the deceased owner’s inheritors into the company and share the work, control, and profits with them



- accept the inheritors as silent, nonworking owners— potentially giving them a free ride if the business prospers

- negotiate with the inheritors to convince them to sell their interest

- negotiate with the inheritors to convince them to buy the rest of the company, or

- liquidate the business.

  If these options haven’t been discussed—and a clear plan enshrined in a  buyout agreement—-beforehand, tensions can arise as the new owners and  the old owners discuss the future of the company. If arguments turn  nasty, resulting in business owners’ losing focus on continuing  operations, the company’s business and reputation can suffer, sometimes  even causing it to fail.

  Family businesses. If yours is truly a family business, your first thought may be, “Well, of  course my family will inherit and hold on to my share of the business.”  Not so fast. This is an issue you should discuss in depth with your  co-owners and your family. Co-owners should frankly talk about whose  kids, if anyone’s, will be welcome to work in the business when one of  you retires or dies. You may well conclude that unless one of your kids  already works in the business and has been fully accepted by your  co-owners, it’s best to provide that no owners’ kids are guaranteed a  spot.

  As part of having this discussion, here are some key questions you and each of your co-owners will want to answer:

- Do your adult children want to take over your position in the company?  Have they shown any interest in the company? Do they have any knowledge  of the business?

- Who do you want to have most control and management of the company? The existing owners? Your inheritors?

- If you want your inheritors to retain their interest in the company and  succeed you, will they really be able to do the work you now do? When?  If not now, who will run the company in the meantime, until your  inheritors have the maturity and skills to take over?

  

  - Do you want your business partners’ inheritors to be able to fill their  shoes? Do you want the right to say “yes, they can” or “no, they can’t,” or “only under these conditions”?

    

    exAMpLe: Mike and his co-owners informally discuss their company’s future when Mike  is 45 years old. Mike gets his co- owners to agree that his son, Josh,  will eventually take over his ownership interest and his management  duties when he retires at age 55. But Mike dies suddenly of a heart  attack at age 50, when Josh has just started college. Josh and his  father’s surviving co-owners agree that he is not ready to take over the business. But Josh wants to hold on to his interest until he graduates,

    at which point he’ll join the company. The surviving owners, however,  don’t want to have to share profits with Josh while he finishes his  education, and they aren’t so sure they want him to take over his  father’s role with no real-life business experience. To try to head off  the problem, they offer Josh a generous lump- sum payment to sell out.  Josh says, “No way. I want to join the company.” Without a buy-sell  agreement, the surviving owners can’t *force* Josh to sell.  Eventually relations between Josh and the other owners deteriorate to  the point where they decide to liquidate the company and go their  separate ways.

    

    Luckily, it’s possible to use your buy-sell agreement to create appropriate  tools to manage what happens when an owner dies. Any owner who wants to  give his business a decent chance to succeed after he dies should work  with his co-owners to create and fund

    a sensible succession strategy. Decisions that are well thought out, made beforehand, and recorded in a buyout agreement can really help avoid  delays, financial problems, and conflicts.

    There are two sides to what your buyout agreement can provide for after the  death of an owner: 1) If one owner should die, and the owners hadn’t  previously agreed that the deceased owners’ children or other relatives  would succeed him, then the continuing owners are likely to want to be  able to buy the deceased owner’s interest from his estate. 2) If you  were to die unexpectedly, undoubtedly you

    

    would want your spouse or children (technically, your estate) to be able to  ask and expect the continuing owners to buy your share from them. Let’s  look at both sides of the equation.

    

    Option to Purchase a Deceased Owner’s Interest

    Whether yours is a family business or not, it’s sometimes not easy to decide  who will continue the company when you or a co-owner dies: the surviving co-owners or the deceased owner’s inheritors, or a combination of both.

    

    The Problem

    Conflicts are almost inevitable during business ownership transitions. When an  inheritor steps into a deceased owner’s shoes, especially if she doesn’t plan to take an active part in the company, it’s likely that her view  of the business will differ from that of the other owners.

    new owners’ needs. The new owner(s) may want to:

- receive cash to pay for estate or state inheritance taxes and administrative expenses

- not work due to lack of experience, age, ability, or desire

- influence decision making to protect or further their interests

- maximize the profits allocated to them as owner, and/or

- sell their interests to outsiders for cash.

  Surviving owners’ needs. The surviving owners may want to:

- keep control of the company to themselves

- share ownership only with those who actively work in the business

- maintain or increase their salaries, and/or

- reinvest earnings and profits in the company rather than distributing them to the new owners.

In addition to these potential problem areas, there is also the  possibility that an inheritor and one or more of the surviving owners  simply won’t like each other.

Family Succession Agreements

Let’s expend a little ink looking at the special problems that the transition of family businesses often brings up. Although it happens less and less these days, some readers of this book may be interested in having their inheritors continue as

owners. (In fact, while about half of family business owners plan on a family  member continuing the business, this only works out a small percentage  of the time.)

First, if you really want your children to succeed you, you need to plan for  the smooth transition of your ownership interest—in writing.  Unfortunately, family members are often touchy about making formal  agreements with each other— some families wrongly believe that a written agreement is a badge of dysfunction.

But, even if your heirs are ready and itching to take over after you die, and the

co-owners of your company (if any) are agreeable, you need to have made a clear  plan. As a result, family businesses are often run on the basis of oral  promises and informal understandings that have never been formalized.  But when the tension produced by the death of a key person arises, this  is almost always a recipe for disaster!

Second, it is crucial that you select inheritors who are willing, and able, to  succeed you. If there’s any doubt that an inheritor won’t be able to  take over for you right away, you might want to choose an interim  successor, such as a long-term employee or a trustee, who can keep the  business running smoothly until your inheritor can take over.

Third, if you have more than one child, it’s important not to confuse your  desire to split up your estate fairly with the fact that only one of  them may be equipped to run the business. Here’s one possible approach:  If you want to leave equal inheritances for your children, but not all  of them are interested in working in and running the business, consider  leaving the business to the children who are active in it and buying  life insurance of equal value for the others. (You should buy insurance  for this purpose early, rather than waiting until you are in your 60s or 70s, when it might be too expensive.) Alternatively, your buyout  agreement can provide for the business-minded child to buy the ownership interests from your other inheritors after your death—but for this to  be enforceable, all of your inheritors must sign the agreement.

The point here is that without an explicit and formal legal structure for  business succession, co-owners, successors, and siblings have been known to get into nasty battles over money and control.



Or, even if both sides like each other fine and have unselfish interests,  there just may not be enough money to go around. Let’s take a look at  how problems can arise even in relatively amiable circumstances.



exAMpLe: Jack and Chris, brothers and good friends, went into the sporting goods  business years ago as partners of a retail store, sharing the profits  equally. They put in long hours both in the store and behind the scenes, buying inventory and keeping the books. Jack married his high school  sweetheart and had three kids, while Chris never married.

One night as he is locking up, Jack suffers a stroke and dies.

Luckily, Jack had some life insurance. But it’s not even close to enough to  support his family indefinitely. Jack’s wife, Pat, imagines continuing  to own Jack’s share of the shop and tells Chris how much she’ll need to  draw against her share of the

profits to take care of herself and her kids. Since this amount is almost as  much as Jack was receiving in salary, Pat is essentially proposing that  she receive close to 50% of the company’s profits without doing any  work. Chris, who is very close to his sister- in-law and nieces and  nephew and wants to do right by them, nevertheless knows the company  can’t operate along the lines

Pat proposes, given the fact that Chris will have to hire someone to take Jack’s place.



The idea is to have a plan in place that allows the surviving owners of the company to make sensible decisions fair to all at the time of an  owner’s death, because when an owner dies, the

surviving owners of the company—not the inheritors—are probably best equipped to make a decision about the company’s future.



The Solution

For the reasons mentioned above, most savvy business owners have their  buyout agreement provide the company and the surviving co- owners with  the option to buy a deceased owner’s interest from his estate or trust.  Normally, such a provision states that when an owner



dies, the company and the surviving owners have the right to buy the interest from the executor of the estate (or the trustee of a trust) that holds  the ownership interest. This clause is referred to as an “Option to  Purchase a Deceased Owner’s Interest.” Of course, under this type of  provision, the surviving owners have the discretion to decide not to buy the interest, if they feel they can work well with any inheritors who  evince an interest in participating in the business.



exAMpLe: Remember Jack and Chris, the two brothers who co- owned a sporting goods store  before Jack died suddenly, leaving a wife, Pat, and their children  behind? Let’s keep the facts the same, except that this time Jack and  Chris had the wisdom to adopt a buyout agreement. When Jack dies, Pat  says she needs an income to support herself and her kids. Chris—who  realizes the company can’t survive if it has to pay half the profits to a nonworking owner—invokes their buyout agreement, which provides that he can buy out Pat’s interest by paying her

$100,000 over three years. Combined with the payoff from a life insurance policy Jack had purchased, this is enough money to give Pat the time she needs to freshen up her skills as a paralegal and go back to work. And it  allows Chris to search for a new partner to share work and profits with.



Understand that this provision, which allows surviving owners to buy out the  interests of the owner who dies first, often results in the owner who  remains alive the longest ending up with the whole business. This is  probably a reasonable outcome, since the last owner to die managed  and/or worked for the company for the longest amount of time.  Nevertheless, you should understand how it can work against your  survivors in some circumstances. Suppose

your son works for the company and wants to succeed you as one of the  owners, but you die before the other owners. If you’ve included an  Option-to-Purchase clause and the company or the surviving owners force  your son to sell out, his career could be over before

it started.



However, a reasonable buyout price can protect your inheritors.

You may not be crazy about the idea of giving the company and surviving  owners the absolute right to buy your share from your estate, rather  than letting it go to your inheritors. But as long as your agreement  ensures that the price paid to your estate for your share is fair—and  you can take pains to make sure that it will be—then

at least you know your inheritors will be justly compensated. We discuss how to set a fair price in Chapter 6.

TIP

Look at the situation from both sides. You usually have no way of



knowing which owner will die first. You could be a surviving owner faced with  the possibility of a deceased co-owner’s unqualified son wanting to join the company. Or, you could be the first co-owner to become critically  ill and die, hoping the others will accept your capable daughter as a  fully participating

co-owner. So, in drafting your agreement, try to balance the future needs of the  owner whose circumstances will have changed against the interests of the company and the other owners as a whole.

CAUTION

Majority owners beware. Majority owners may want to change their agreement so that this provision  doesn’t apply to them, particularly if it’s a family business and they  expect a son or daughter to succeed them. To avoid being restricted  under any provision of a buyout agreement, a majority owner simply needs to add a sentence at the end of the provision, such as: “This section  applies only to owners of less than 50% of the interests in the  company.” Note that if you do this, however, the Agreement Price will  not set the value of the ownership interests for estate tax purposes.  This is another example of why a majority owner should consult a small  business expert before signing a buyout agreement.



Right of Estate, Trust, or Inheritors to Force a Sale

Up until now, we’ve talked about situations where the company or surviving owners *want* to buy out a deceased owner’s interest from her estate. But what happens  to a deceased owner’s inheritors if the company or the surviving owners  do not choose to buy the deceased owner’s interest (for instance,  because the company is short of funds)?



The Problem

There are many reasons inheritors might want to promptly sell their  interest—for instance, they’re not interested in working in the company; they’re too young, too old, or unqualified; or they may

simply have other places to spend or invest the proceeds they could get from  selling their interests. And, as we discussed in Chapter 1,

it can be difficult to impossible to find an outside buyer for a partial interest in a small business.



exAMpLe: Juan, Anna, and Diane buy a parking garage down- town with savings. Juan dies suddenly in a car accident soon afterward. His wife, Angelina, inherits his interest in the garage. Unable to survive on her salary alone,  Angelina asks Anna and Diane to buy out her share of the garage. Anna  and Diane, however, with no surplus funds to buy her out, say “not right now.” Juan’s wife looks for an outside buyer, but no one wants to  purchase a minority interest in the business, since the business will  continue to be controlled by Anna and Diane. Angelina and her kids are  stuck. She is eventually all but forced to sign over her share in the  company to pay her bills, getting credit for far less than her share of  the business was really worth.



The Solution

To deal with this potential problem, you may want your agreement to  contain a Right-to-Force-a-Sale clause that requires the company or the  surviving owners to buy back the interest of a deceased owner if the  estate representative, trustee, or inheritors want to sell it. For  instance, if an owner dies and leaves his ownership interest to his wife

Probate Fees and Estate Taxes

If you are planning for your heirs to take over your position in the  company, you should address the issue of debt and taxes before you die.  On the personal side, your estate may have to pay probate costs, funeral expenses, and final illness bills.

On the business side, the estate may owe estate taxes because of the value of your company, assuming there is an estate tax when you die. Where  will this money come from? Without advance planning, your heirs could  have to take working capital from the company or even sell the business  to pay for these expenses.



exAMpLe: Hillary and her brother Mike run a bed and breakfast on the edge of town, which provides them with a satisfying and fairly profitable living. They have a steady, seasonal clientele, who keep returning because of Hillary’s  gracious hospitality and Mike’s gourmet cooking.

Mike dies unexpectedly and leaves his share of the business to his daughter  Miriam, using a probate-avoiding living trust. Hillary welcomes Miriam  to the B&B, since she and Miriam get along fine. So far, so good,  but to pay state inheritance taxes, funeral expenses, and several big  debts that her father had left behind, Miriam must take out a mortgage  on the building that houses the bed and breakfast. On top of the  financial strain the mortgage causes, Miriam doesn’t know how to cook,  so they have to hire a third person to replace Mike. And, still  depressed by her brother’s death, Hillary is in no mood to play the  happy hostess much of the time. Eventually, when word spreads that the  quality of the food and hospitality at the bed and breakfast has  declined, bookings drop off. Before long, Miriam can’t make her loan  payments, and Hillary doesn’t have the cash to buy her out. They end up  hurriedly selling their B&B for less than its real value.



Although planning ahead won’t deal with the sadness that accompanies the loss of a loved one, you can protect your heirs from a financial squeeze by  planning ahead for money problems. One way to do this is by purchasing  enough life insurance, to be paid to your inheritors upon your death, so that they can pay any debts, taxes, and bills your estate may owe  without having to take it out of the business you took so long to build  up. Another way is to plan ahead to lower your eventual estate taxes. We discuss estate taxes in detail in Chapter 9.



and children, and they need cash for their expenses (to pay bills or to  fund tuition), they have the power to force the company to buy back the  interest.

The purpose of this clause is to guard against the possibility that neither the company nor the surviving owners want to buy the deceased owner’s  share from the deceased owner’s estate, trust, or inheritors.

Of course, making sure funds will be available to pay for a buyout is a  key part to making sure a buyout after the death of an owner does not  bankrupt the company. One way to do this is for the company to take out  an appropriate amount of life insurance on the life of each owner. The  company pays the premiums on each policy and receives the benefits from  them when an owner dies.

The insurance policy payoff is then available to buy the interest of the  deceased owner. (We discuss using insurance to fund buyout agreements in more detail in Chapter 5.)



exAMpLe: Let’s give Juan’s wife and kids a better outcome with a buyout agreement.  Remember that Juan, Anna, and Diane owned a downtown parking garage when Juan died suddenly in a car accident. His wife, Angelina, inherited his interest in the garage. Needing cash to pay for living expenses for  herself and

her children, Angelina invokes the Right-to-Force-a-Sale clause in the  company’s buy-sell agreement to require Anna and Diane to buy out her  share of the garage. Since their agreement required the purchase of life insurance policies on each owner, Anna and Diane have no problem buying out Angelina at the price in their agreement with the proceeds from the life insurance policies.

Now Angelina, Diane, and Anna can part on good terms, since all of them feel fairly treated.



The Right-to-Force-a-Sale clause in our buyout agreement is shown below.  Note that this provision does not allow the holder of a deceased owner’s interest to require the company and the continuing owners to buy just a portion of the deceased owner’s interest. They must offer all or  nothing.

n option 2:  right of estate, trust, or Inheritors to Force a Sale

1. When an owner dies, the executor or administrator of the deceased owner’s  estate, or the trustee of a trust holding the deceased owner’s ownership interest, or the deceased owner’s inheritors can require the company  and the continuing owners to buy all, but not less than all, of the  deceased owner’s ownership interest by delivering to the company within  60 days a notice of intention to force a sale (“Notice

of Intent to Force a Sale”) in writing. The notice shall include the name  and address of the deceased owner, the date of death, a description and  amount of the owner’s interest in the company, the name and address of  the person exercising the right to force the sale, and a statement that  this person wishes to force a sale of the interest due to the owner’s  death as provided in this provision. The procedure for purchase

of the ownership interest shall be according to Section IV, Provision 2 of this agreement. The price to be paid, the manner of payments and other  terms of the purchase shall be according to Sections VI and VII of this  agreement. An owner who has died is referred to as a “deceased owner”  below.

You Can Customize Any Buyout Option to Make It Mandatory

Another way to plan ahead for the death of a co-owner is to adopt a buyout agreement that *requires* the company or the remaining owners to buy the interest of the deceased  owner from his estate. In other words, after an owner dies, the company  or the surviving owners would have

no choice but to buy the deceased owner’s share. This clause, however—  often called a mandatory purchase provision—takes away much of the  surviving owners’ discretion and doesn’t provide much flexibility for  either side.

We believe it should be used only in limited circumstances, and only after consultation with a small business lawyer. If you do decide to *require* the company or the continuing owners to purchase a deceased owner’s  interest, in Subsection (a) of Option 1, simply cross out the words “an  option, but not an obligation (unless otherwise stated in this  agreement),” and write in “an obligation.”

In fact, any of the Options to Purchase in our buy-sell agreement can be  made mandatory in this way—but we don’t see the need for this in most  cases. We think it’s better to let the parties decide at the time of the business-changing event, when they have more information than the  drafters of the buyout agreement do today.



If an Owner Divorces

If you don’t cover the possibility of divorce in your buyout agreement,  you’ll have to face the possibility that if a co-owner gets divorced,  the owner’s ex could become your new business partner! The co- owner who is getting a divorce may have no power to stop this in

a situation where, under state law, a judge has the power to divide  marital property. And we hope you don’t need us to tell you that, at a  time when one in two marriages ends in divorce, it’s just plain silly to overlook this possibility.



The Problem

Absent a bulletproof premarital agreement (an oxymoron if there ever was one), in which spouses agree to keep their property separate, chances are  good that your business partner’s spouse has a legal interest in your  company. This is certainly true in community property states (Arizona,  California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico,

Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), where each spouse owns one-half of all the  couple’s community property. (Community property includes most property  earned or accumulated after the wedding.) And, practically speaking,  it’s likely to be true in most other states as well, where “equitable  distribution” laws require that marital property

be divided fairly during divorce. (Not to mention inheritance laws, which  normally require that a surviving spouse receive at least one- third to  one-half of a deceased spouse’s estate.)

An inexperienced or mistrustful ex-spouse may not have the company’s best  interests at heart. For instance, ex-spouses sometimes want to get as  much money as they can out of the company in the short term, even at the risk of damaging the company’s long-term prospects.

Perhaps the most troublesome prospect of becoming co-owner with an owner’s  ex-spouse involves a situation where the owner who gets a divorce is  still involved in the business.



exAMpLe: Mike and Marti, friends from college, start a medical supply company while  Mike is married to Betsy. A few years later, Mike and Betsy file for  divorce. Betsy’s lawyer demands half of Mike’s interest in the company.  Mike, having few other assets, has no choice but to sign it over as part of a property settlement agreement. Mike and Marti dread being in  business with Betsy, who has a dozen reasons to be mad at Mike and, by  extension, his friend Marti. Betsy insists on being involved in the  day-to-day decisions of running the business, and the three owners argue all the time and can’t agree on a direction for the business. Without a buy-sell agreement, Mike and Marti

have no way to force her to sell her interest and, as a result, they eventually disband the company.



The Solution

A “contemplation-of-divorce” buyout provision protects the owners of the  company from having to work with potentially undesirable ex- spouses.  Under such a provision, the company and the other owners can buy the  ownership interest received by a former spouse if they choose, at the  price in the agreement. However, and this is a big however, ex-spouses  cannot be required to sell back their interest if they did not sign the  original buyout agreement.

To avoid this prospect, all married owners should have their spouses read  and sign the buyout agreement. By signing, the spouse agrees to sell any interest received in a divorce settlement back to the company or to the other owners at the standard buyout price set in the agreement (the  “Agreement Price,” discussed in Chapter 6), if the owners so request.

If the company and the other owners decide not to buy back the interest  from the ex-spouse (meaning the ex-spouse becomes a bona fide owner),  the spouse agrees to abide by the terms of the buyout agreement that are applicable to all owners. Again, remember, contractual provisions  contained in a buyout agreement don’t have  to be binding if none of the parties want them to be when a change of circumstance occurs. Owners  have buyout agreements to protect and define their rights, not to freeze them in legal straitjackets.

For example, suppose that, despite a forced buyout provision, the remaining owners actually like the ex-spouse—perhaps even better than they ever  liked their old business partner—and want her to join the business. As  long as she agrees, this is no problem, since, when all parties agree,  any agreement can be changed.

TIP

The buyout agreement should mesh with any prenuptial



agreement. If any couples also prepare prenuptial agreements defining their property  ownership, they should contain the same provisions as the buyout  agreement regarding business ownership.



The language of the “contemplation of divorce” clause contained in our  buyout agreement, which includes the options mentioned above, is shown  below. Note that it gives the divorced owner the first chance to buy  back the interest awarded by a court to his former spouse, and then  gives the company and all owners (including the divorced owner) a chance to buy the interest. We think this makes sense—it allows divorced  owners to return to their status quo ownership position in the company  by buying the interest back from their former spouses—if they can afford it.

WORkSHEET

When the owners ask their spouses to sign the agreement, they need to make  sure the spouses understand what they’re signing. In at least one case,  the court refused to enforce a provision in a buyout agreement requiring an ex-spouse to sell back an interest received as part of a divorce,  even though the ex-spouse had signed the agreement. The ex- spouse, who  didn’t work in the business or have a financial background, successfully argued that she never understood the agreement (and

that she wasn’t represented by a lawyer). To avoid the possibility of this  happening, in our agreement, the spouses who sign the agreement agree  that they understand the agreement and have had opportunity to hire a  lawyer of their own (“independent counsel”) to advise them. You could  also have the spouses sign and attach an acknowledgment that they have  received a copy of your company’s financial report and fully expect the  agreement to be binding in case of divorce.

Scenario 4.  When an owner’s Interest Is transferred to his or her Former Spouse

n option 1: option of company and continuing owners to purchase Former Spouse’s Interest

1. If, in connection with the divorce or dissolution of the marriage of an  owner, a court issues a decree or order that transfers, confirms, or  awards part or all of an ownership interest to a divorced owner’s former spouse, the former spouse is deemed to have offered his or her newly  acquired ownership interest to the divorced owner for purchase on the  date of the court award or settlement, according to the terms of this  agreement. If the divorced owner does not elect to make such purchase  within 30 days of the date of the court award or settlement, the former  spouse of the divorced owner is deemed to have offered his or her newly  acquired ownership interest to the company and the co-owners (including  the divorced owner) for purchase, according to the terms of this  agreement.

   The divorced owner must send notice to the company, in writing, that his or her former spouse now owns an ownership interest in the company.

   The notice shall state the name and address of the owner, the name and  address of the divorced owner’s former spouse, a description and amount  of the interest awarded to the former spouse, and the date of the court  award. If no notice is received by the company from the divorced owner,  an offer to the company and the co-owners is deemed to have occurred  when the company actually receives notice orally or in writing of the  court award or settlement transferring the divorced owner’s interest to  the owner’s former spouse. The company and the co-owners (including the  divorced owner) shall then have an option, but not an obligation (unless otherwise stated in this agreement), to purchase all or part of

   the ownership interest within the time and according to the procedure in  Section IV, Provision 1 of this agreement. The price to be paid, the  manner of payments and other terms of the purchase shall be according to Sections VI and VII of this agreement.

   So far we have covered the most common scenarios that happen to the owners of small businesses. In the rest of this chapter, we deal with a few  less likely scenarios: the loss of a professional license, the personal  bankruptcy of an owner, a default on a personal loan, and the expulsion  of an owner. First, let’s look at what happens if an owner loses his  professional or vocational license.

   

   The Problem

   When an owner loses a license that he needs to do the job, the owner can be  prevented from working. For example, a veterinarian cannot legally treat animals without a veterinarian’s license. What will happen to your  business if your co-owner loses his professional or vocational license,  keeping him from doing his job for a year or more?

   Does the owner have to offer his interest for sale back to the company or to the still-licensed owners? Even absent a buyout agreement, the law of  many states require this for some professions (in California, for  example, you can’t be a partner in a law firm without being a licensed  lawyer). Other states don’t address this issue. Regardless of what your  state says on the issue, it’s good to address this situation in your  buyout agreement to deal with the issues of how much the departing  owner’s interest is worth and what kind of payment method should be  required.

   

   exAMpLe: Betty and Zach start a professional corporation to engage in the practice of  architecture. After he starts to drink heavily, Zach begins improperly  using a client’s funds. After a hearing, the state board revokes his  license. Because Zach is no longer able to work, Betty demands that he  sell his interest in the firm to her. When Betty refuses to pay Zach’s  asking price for his ownership share, she has to sue him, claiming he  deserves very little for his share because his own wrongdoing greatly  harmed the firm’s reputation. While the outcome is hard to call, it is  certain that both parties will rack up attorneys’ fees.

   

   The Solution

   If you find this little scenario sobering, it’s likely you’ll want to  include loss of license in your buyback scenarios. Your buyout agreement can require a co-owner who has his license suspended or revoked to  relinquish his duties and sell his ownership interest back to the  company or to the other owners. This protects the owners of the company  from having to share profits with someone who can no longer practice and may be in disrepute.

   In addition, you may want to provide that the company or the continuing  owners can pay less than full value for the interest of an owner who has lost his license. For instance, your agreement can allow the company or the remaining owners to purchase the owner’s share at 40% to 50% of the full agreement price—to allow

   for the possibility that the conduct that caused the co-owner to lose his  license may have hurt the reputation of your business or lost the  company clients. Or, you may simply want to provide for a new appraisal  of the company’s value to establish its current worth given what has  happened. (We discuss appraisals in Chapter 6.)

   The language of the loss-of-license provision in our agreement, with the price options we discussed, is shown below.

   If an Owner Files for Personal Bankruptcy

   When an owner can’t pay his bills and files for bankruptcy protec- tion, it affects not only *his* future, but the company’s as well.

   

   The Problem

   When a business owner files for personal bankruptcy, a bankruptcy trustee (a clerk of the bankruptcy court) has the right to gather and sell all of  the debtor’s nonexempt property, including her stake in a co-owned  business, to pay off creditors.

   Depending on state law and on how your business is organized, there can be three  ways a bankruptcy trustee could use a bankrupt owner’s ownership  interest to pay off creditors, including:

   - selling the ownership interest

   - selling a proportional share of the business’s assets, such as business equipment and inventory, or

   - forcing the entire company to be liquidated.

     In reality, however, even if the bankruptcy trustee does take hold of the  ownership interest, circumstances rarely require the trustee

     to take drastic measures (in fact, in many situations, the trustee is  allowed to try to sell only the ownership interest as is, not any

     equipment or inventory of the business). As long as the company or the co-owners  are willing to pay the trustee a reasonable amount of money for the  ownership interest in question, the bankruptcy trustee will usually be  willing to sell it back to them. The trustee should be glad to have the  cash to pay off the bankrupt owner’s creditors.

     But while the bankruptcy trustee is trying to sort things out, your company can end up in legal and ownership limbo while the trustee holds the  ownership interest—a situation banks and other creditors would not take  kindly to.

     

     The Solution

     It follows that the company and the remaining owners will want the means  to prevent a bankruptcy trustee or others from selling a bankrupt  owner’s ownership interest. No question, it pays to plan

     to keep the bankruptcy trustee from taking an ownership interest in the  first place, to avoid any possibility that an ownership interest gets  tied up in bankruptcy court or, in a worst-case scenario, that your  company might be liquidated.

     To do this, your agreement can require an owner to give the company 30 or  60 days’ notice before filing for bankruptcy, to give the company time  to structure a purchase. Our agreement also states that this notice of  an imminent bankruptcy filing is considered an automatic offer to sell  his ownership interest back to the company or to the other owners  immediately, at which point the company and the co-owners can purchase  it if they choose to.

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_067.png)

     CAUTION

     pay a fair price for a bankrupt owner’s shares. Even if a co-owner

     

     sells his interest back to the company or continuing owners before filing for bankruptcy, a bankruptcy trustee has the power to disallow and reverse  the transaction (and may well do so if it looks like a phony or  underpriced

     transaction). To reduce the likelihood of this happening, you should pay the standard buyout price set in the agreement (the “Agreement Price,” discussed in  Chapter 6) for the bankrupt owner’s interest.

     

     Of course, people don’t always follow their buy-sell agreement, especially when they have little to lose. To be safe, if an owner violates the  buyout agreement by filing for bankruptcy without first giving notice to his co-owners (in which case the company can’t buy out the ownership  interest before the bankruptcy filing takes place), our agreement  provides that an owner who obtains or becomes subject to a bankruptcy  order is automatically subject to the buyback provisions contained in  your buy-sell agreement.

     SEE AN ExPERT

     consult with a bankruptcy attorney. Should a co-owner get

     

     into serious financial problems, step one should be for everyone involved to consult with an experienced bankruptcy lawyer.

     

     The clause in our agreement that contains the bankruptcy filing scenario we discussed is shown below.

     n option 1: option of company and continuing owners to purchase Interest of an owner Who has Filed for Bankruptcy

     1. When an owner is planning to file for bankruptcy, he or she must give notice to the company, in writing, [*insert* *number of days, such as "30" or "60"*] days before he or she files for bankruptcy. The notice shall state the  name and address of the owner, a description and amount of the owner’s  interest and the expected date of filing by the owner for bankruptcy.  This notice shall be deemed to constitute an offer by the owner to sell  his or her interest to the company or the other owners. If an owner  files for bankruptcy without giving notice, the date when the company  learns of the filing for bankruptcy will be deemed to be the date of  this notice. The company and the continuing owners shall then have an  option, but not an obligation (unless otherwise stated in this  agreement), to purchase all or part of the ownership interest within the time and according to the procedure in Section IV, Provision 1 of this  agreement. The price to be paid, the manner of payments and other terms  of the purchase shall be according to Sections VI and VII of this  agreement. An owner who has filed for bankruptcy is referred to as a  “bankrupt owner” below.

     If an Owner Defaults on a Personal Loan

     After reading this section, you and your co-owners will have to decide  whether owners will have the right to offer their ownership interests as collateral for personal loans—called “encumbering their interest.”  Buyout provisions can restrict owners from using their ownership  interest in this way.

     

     The Problem

     If an owner defaults on the loan for which his ownership interest was  pledged as collateral, the creditor can foreclose and take title to the  ownership interest.

     

     exAMpLe: Chris and Lisa run a medical supply corporation together. They have a  buy-sell agreement with a foreclosure clause. Chris comes up with an  idea for reducing inflammation for patients with arm or elbow injuries.  It consists of a sleeve filled with a gelatinous substance that can be  cooled in the freezer and then pulled over the arm, icing the whole arm  at once. Lisa doesn’t want any part of funding the development and sale  of this new product, because she doesn’t think the product will sell.

     Undaunted by Lisa’s lack of enthusiasm, Chris sets up a separate sole  proprietorship and applies for a patent. Then, to finance development  costs, he gets a loan from the bank by offering his one-half interest in the medical supply company as

     

     collateral. Due to a manufacturing problem, Chris has no product to sell and misses his first three loan payments, with the result that the bank starts to  foreclose on his share of the medical supply company.

     

     The Solution

     Our buyout agreement provides two options: one that prohibits encumbering  an ownership interest, and another that allows encumbrances with added  provisions in case of default.

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_071.gif)

     

     Scenario 7. encumbrance of Interest option 2: no encumbrance Allowed

     No owner may encumber any or all of his ownership interest in

     the company in connection with any debt, guarantee, or other personal undertaking.

     

     prohibiting encumbrances. To avoid the problem entirely, some owners choose to prohibit owners’  shares from being used as collateral for personal loans. The provision  in our agreement that forbids owners from pledging their ownership  interests for loans is shown below.

     

     

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_072.png)

     WORkSHEET

     turn to your worksheet. If you do not want to allow the owners of your company to be able to use  their ownership interests as collateral for personal loans, check Option 2 on your worksheet now. (Section III, Scenario 7.)

     

     Allowing encumbrances. After reflection, you, like many business owners, may decide not to prohibit  owners from using their interest in the company as collateral for  borrowing money, since to do so would mean you and your business  partners might have a greatly

     

     reduced ability to qualify for personal loans. Especially for owners who have  most of their net worth tied up in the business, it can be overly harsh  to prevent owners from borrowing against the business. It could even  result in their being unable to reinvest their profits in the company  because of a personal shortage of cash.

     If encumbrances are allowed, your buyout agreement will include a  provision to handle the situation where an owner defaults on a personal  loan and a creditor seeks foreclosure of the ownership interest. If an  owner defaults on the loan and the creditor threatens to foreclose and  take title to the interest, the company (and/or the other owners) have  the right to “cure” the default—that is, pay off the loan and take back  the interest from the defaulting owner or the creditor.

     

     exAMpLe: Let’s go back to Chris and Lisa’s company. When Lisa gets wind that the bank  is preparing to foreclose on Chris’s share of the company, she reads  their buy-sell agreement and discovers she can pay off Chris’s loan to  the bank and, in exchange, take control of Chris’s shares. Fortunately,  Lisa is able to quickly gather financing and savings to repay Chris’s  debt.

     The creditor accepts Lisa’s payment for the interest and stops foreclosure  proceedings, because the bank is happy just to close out the loan.

     TIP

     Keep tabs on any personal pledges of ownership interests to

     

     secure loans. If you learn of a default by an owner on a loan secured by an ownership  interest, notify the creditor immediately of the company’s and the  co-owners’ buyback rights under your agreement.

     

     This buyout provision prevents an outside creditor (or the person or entity  to whom the creditor sells the interest) from gaining a

     share of the company and possibly a say in management—the main predicament your buyout agreement is meant to avoid.

     

     Of course, the amount that the company or nondefaulting owners (whoever  buys the ownership interest of the defaulting owner) pay to the creditor to pay off the loan is likely to be higher or lower than the standard  buyout price set in the agreement (the “Agreement Price,” discussed in  Chapter 6). If the amount that the company or nondefaulting owners pay  to the creditor is less than the Agreement Price, they are required to  pay the remainder of the Agreement Price to the defaulting owner. If the amount that the company or nondefaulting owners pay to the creditor is  more than the Agreement Price, the defaulting owner owes them  difference.

     The language in our buyout agreement that allows encumbrances and includes this buyback option is shown below.

     

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_074.png)

     TIP

     place a legend on any stock certificates. If you allow owners

     

     to encumber their ownership interests, you should place a legend on any  certificates of ownership (which usually only exist for stock in a  corporation) to give notice to others who lend money based on ownership  interests that the interest cannot be freely disposed of, but must be  sold to the company or co-owners under the terms of your buyout  agreement. We show you how to do this in “Placing a Legend on Your  Certificates” in Chapter 8.

     option 1: encumbrances Allowed Subject to option of company and continuing owners to purchase Interest

     1. Any owner may encumber any or all of his ownership interest in the company  in connection with any debt, but any such encumbrance is subject to the  following condition:

     2. If an owner defaults on a debt secured by his or her ownership interest,  he or she must promptly give notice in writing to the company. The  notice shall include the name and address of the owner, a description  and amount of the owner’s interest in the company, the date and  description of the encumbrance on the owner’s interest, and the date and description of any action taken by creditors as a result

        of the default. If no notice is provided by the owner, notice shall be  considered given to the company on the date the company learns of the  owner’s default or of any action by a creditor as a result of the  default. (An owner who defaults on a debt secured by his or her  ownership interest is referred to as a “defaulting owner” below.) The  company and the continuing owners shall then have an option, but not an  obligation (unless otherwise stated in this agreement), to pay off the  debt and to take title to the interest.

     3. If the amount paid to the creditor (debt plus any interest) is less than  the Agreement Price selected in Section VI of this agreement, the  remainder of the Agreement Price shall be paid to the defaulting owner  by the buyer of his or her ownership interest. If the amount paid to the creditor (debt plus any interest) is more than the Agreement Price  selected in Section VI of this agreement, the defaulting owner shall owe the difference to the buyer of his or her ownership interest.

     4. If the company and/or the other owners do not cure the default as provided in Subsection (b) above, the creditor may pursue any and all legal and  equitable remedies.

     

     If an Owner Needs to Be Expelled

     Expelling a co-owner from your business can be a wrenching experience, one you  surely hope you never have to encounter. Certainly many new business  owners find it very difficult to even consider this possibility. But  putting your head in the sand and pretending you’ll never have to deal  with a co-owner who fails to adequately perform her job-related  duties—or breaks the law—is a serious mistake. When bad things happen to the owners of good companies, you need to be able to deal with them.

     Here is a short list of some of the unhappy possibilities you may have to cope with:

   - An owner becomes seriously alcohol or drug dependent and jeopardizes the company’s welfare.

   - An owner exhibits disturbing personal behavior patterns such as extreme anger or depression.

   - An owner loses interest in the business and endangers its profitability.

   - An owner steals from the business or is otherwise dishonest.

   - An owner engages in unacceptable conduct at work, such as harassing co-workers.

To cope with an owner who is irresponsible, untrustworthy, or just not performing up to the company’s standards, it can make

sense to include in your buyout agreement a provision that requires such an  owner to relinquish his duties and sell his ownership interest to the  company or the other owners. Sounds good, but actually implementing such a clause can be tricky.

cause for expulsion. Whether an owner really is underperforming or acting badly is usually a matter  of opinion. That’s why, if you want your agreement to cover this  scenario, it’s a good idea to put reasons for expelling an owner  explicitly into your agreement. Then an owner who signs the agreement  can’t later claim that it’s unfair.

Our agreement allows you to define adequate cause as criminal conduct  against the company and/or a serious breach of duty or of company  policy. It also allows you to write in your own reasons.



Consider including a list of specific grounds that constitute “adequate cause”  for expulsion, such as “alcohol or drug abuse that jeopardizes the  welfare of the company.” In real life, people can and do challenge  “adequate cause” in wrongful termination suits, but at least if you’ve  set out some standards to measure against, you’ll be ahead of the game.  If you don’t check any of the adequate clause options in our agreement  or write in any reasons for expulsion, adequate cause will be determined at the time of expulsion.

Full vs. discounted price. If the co-owner’s failure to meet her obligations is objective and clear,  your agreement can provide a method for discounting the buyout price  according to possible impairment of your company’s reputation. For  instance, your agreement can allow the company or the remaining owners  to purchase the share of an expelled owner at 50% of the standard buyout price set in the agreement (the “Agreement Price,” discussed in Chapter 6)—to allow for the possibility that the co-owner’s conduct has hurt  the business’s economic future. Or, you may simply want to provide for a new appraisal of the company to establish its current worth. (We  discuss the procedure for getting an appraisal in Chapter 6.) However,  in order to avoid more bitterness than is already likely to surround any expulsion, you may want to provide that the company or the continuing  owners will repurchase an expelled owner’s interest at the full  Agreement Price, not at a discounted price.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_077.png)

CAUTION

expulsion may be one area where you do not want to allow



binding arbitration. Arbitration (discussed in Chapter 8) is a method of settling a conflict where a  neutral third party makes a decision rather than a judge. For many  people, it’s a better choice than going to court, but in this situation, an arbitrator might decide that you can’t expel a partner or other

co-owner when you think it is absolutely necessary for your business’s survival.

So you may not want the arbitration required by the agreement to apply to  expulsion. To accomplish this, at the end of your expulsion clause, add a

declaration that “any expulsion decision is absolutely final and is not subject



to arbitration or other review, including review by any court.” (This will make the arbitration clause not apply, since the arbitration clause in  our agreement starts with the phrase, “Except as otherwise provided in  this agreement.”)



The expulsion clause included in our buyout agreement is shown below.

Scenario 8. expulsion of owner

n option 1: option of company and continuing owners to purchase an expelled owner’s Interest

1. At a time when the company has three or more owners, situations may arise  in which a group of owners wish to expel another owner. An owner may be  expelled upon a unanimous vote of all other owners for adequate cause.  Upon such expulsion, the expelled owner is deemed to have offered to  sell all of his or her interest to the company and the continuing  owners. The company and the continuing owners shall then have an option, but not an obligation (unless otherwise stated in this agreement), to  purchase all or part of the ownership interest within the time and  according to the procedure in Section IV, Provision 1 of this agreement. The price to be paid shall be as specified in this section; if not so  specified, then according to Section VI of this agreement. The manner of payments and other terms of the purchase shall be according to Section  VII of this agreement. An owner who has been expelled is referred to as  an “expelled owner” below.

2. Adequate cause includes, but is not limited to:

   n option 1a: Any criminal conduct against the company (such as embezzlement)

   n option 1b: A serious breach of the owner’s duties or of any written policy of the company

   n option 1c: [insert reasons]                              

3. If an owner is expelled for a reason listed in Subsection (b), the price  that the company and/or the continuing owners will pay for the expelled  owner’s ownership interest will be:

   n option 1d:  The full Agreement price according to Section VI of this agreement

   n option 1e: decided by an independent appraisal, according to the Appraised Value Method in Section VI of this agreement

   n **option 1f: The Agreement price as established in Section VI of this agreement, decreased by** [*insert percentage, such* *as “50”*]**%**

   

   Our expulsion provision applies only to businesses with more than two  owners. If you own your business with one other person, you will not be  able to expel that person. This means that if your co-owner is acting  badly or not working up to par, unless you convince her to sell out,  your only other option might be to disband the company.

   If your company has only two owners, you may want to ask a small business  attorney with expertise in buy-sell agreements to fashion a buyout  provision that provides for this situation. There is a commonly used  provision for two-owner companies where one owner names a buyout price  and the other owner has the option to either buy the other owner’s  interest at that price or to sell his own interest at that price. This  is sometimes called a “Texas shootout” or “Russian roulette” provision.  However, you’ll need to hire a lawyer to draft this provision for you to take into account both owners’ strategic and financial positions.

   ### I

   

   n Chapters 2 and 3, we discussed how you can use buyout  provisions—including the Right of First Refusal, the Option to Purchase  an Owner’s Interest, and the Right to Force a Sale—to

   control who owns your company and to give departing owners a mechanism to cash  out. If you include any of these provisions in your buyout agreement, at some point during your company’s life, the company or the continuing  owners will probably purchase a departing owner’s interest. To ensure  that all buyout situations are handled smoothly, your buyout agreement  also provides *how* a future buyout will be carried out.

   Our agreement’s buyout procedure includes the following details:

   - how and when the company and the continuing owners decide who will buy the  ownership interest of the selling, departing, or deceased owner (we’ll  call that owner the “transferring” owner, and the ownership interest at  stake the “available interest”). In other words, our agreement provides a framework for deciding whether the company itself or the owners who  will remain in the company (we’ll call them the “continuing owners”)  will buy the available interest.

   - how and when the company and continuing owners must notify the transferring owner that they will purchase the available interest.

     We explain how our buyout agreement handles these items below. The only  choices you’ll have to make in this chapter involve the number of days  for decisions, notices, and the like.

     

     Company Versus Co-Owners as Buyers

     There are three common approaches to implementing a buyout. The main  difference among these methods involves who will buy the transferring  owner’s interest—the company, the continuing owners, or a combination of the two. For the reasons explained below, our agreement allows a  combination of buyers, using a “Wait and See” approach.

     

     Company as Buyer

     This first type of buyback procedure is called an “entity purchase buyback,” or a redemption buyback for corporations. When an owner retires, dies,  or wants to sell out, only the company (the “entity”) has the option, or sometimes the obligation—depending on what clauses are included in the  buyout agreement—to buy the transferring owner’s interest in the  company.

     If the company itself buys the available interest, here is what happens.  In a corporation, the company simply cancels the redeemed shares after a buyback, and the continuing shareholders’ ownership percentages in the  company increase accordingly (though the number of shares they own will  not change).

     In a partnership or an LLC, after the company buys an owner’s interest,  the interest is “liquidated” and the continuing partners’ or members’  ownership percentages increase.

     The entity purchase method is popular because it allows company funds  rather than personal funds or personal loans to complete a buyout. But  the main advantage of this method is its simplicity. By deciding who  will buy the transferring owner’s interest far in advance of the actual  buyback, this method eliminates the need to decide who will make the  buyback at the time of the buyout.

     However, because this method is so simple, it lacks flexibility. For example, it doesn’t give one or more continuing owners the option of buying the  ownership interest themselves, an approach that can sometimes result in  significant income and capital gains tax advantages to both the  continuing owners and the transferring

     owner. In short, since changing tax laws as well as constant changes in  companies’ and owners’ situations make it impossible to know years in  advance whether it would be best have the company or the continuing  owners buy the interest in question, it makes sense to allow an informed decision to be made at the time of the buyout.

     CAUTION

     corporations and LLcs can’t always buy out a departing owner.

     

     As a rule, state corporation and LLC laws prevent a corporation or an LLC  from buying back an owner’s interest if specific financial solvency  tests cannot be met. generally, state law requires that, after a  buyback, the company’s assets must exceed its liabilities (sometimes by a specified amount). For example, a state may say that a company’s assets must

     be at least one and one-half times its liabilities after the buyback. And, almost as a universal rule, to participate in a buyback the corporation or LLC must be able to pay its debts as they become due after the  buyback (that is, the company must remain solvent after the purchase of  the owner’s interest).

     Rather than worry too much about these restrictions now, just realize that in  the future, if your corporation or LLC would have to use most or all of  its cash reserves to buy back a departing owner’s interest, it might not be lawful to go forward with the deal. In this case, you might want one or more co-owners to be able to individually buy back an owner’s  interest. Which, of course, is another way of saying that it’s important to have a buyout agreement procedure in place that lets you decide at  the time of the buyout who should buy the shares of a transferring  owner.

     

     Financial Solvency Tests

     

     To buy back the interest of a departing owner, a company is required to be in good financial shape—in other words, to have sufficient surplus  funds available. (See “Financial Solvency Tests,” just below.)

     

     

     Co-Owners as Buyers

     The second common type of buyback procedure is called a “cross- purchase  buyback.” Under this approach, when an owner retires, dies, or wants to  sell out, only the continuing owners—not the business itself—have an  option (or sometimes an obligation, depending on what clauses are  included in the agreement) to purchase that owner’s interest.

     Usually, this method allows each continuing owner to purchase a share of the  departing owner’s interest in proportion to his or her current holdings  (for instance, a 10% owner—that is, a person holding 10% of the total  interests held by all continuing owners— can purchase 10% of the  ownership interest in question). Since the company itself is not a party to this type of agreement, it cannot purchase the transferring owner’s  interest itself.

     Two problems with co-owners’ individually buying out a departing owner is  that when a company has more than two or three owners, this method can  get complicated in terms of notice requirements, and insurance funding  becomes harder to deal with (see “Buying Insurance” in Chapter 5). And,  like the entity purchase buyback, this procedure does not allow the  flexibility of deciding at the time of the buyout who should buy the  ownership interest: the company or the continuing owners. When you’re  forming your

     buyout agreement, you may not have the necessary information you need to make  the best decision—taxwise and financially—as to who should buy a  departing owner’s interest.

     RELATED TOPIC

     We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of owner- sponsored buyouts briefly in “Income tax Issues” in chapter 9. Note, how- ever, that this is a complicated area. In the future, before  deciding to buy out an owner’s interest, you should get a tax expert’s  opinion. In particular, if your company is a partnership or an LLC, make sure that the continuing owners’ purchase of another owner’s interest  does not cause a “tax termination” of the partnership or LLC, which can  be costly. (For more information, see “Income Tax Termination of  Partnerships and LLCs” in Chapter 9.)

     

     “Wait and See” Approach

     This third type of buyback procedure (a combination of the entity purchase  and cross-purchase buyback) usually works best for most buyout  situations. That’s because it affords both the company and the  continuing owners an option to purchase an owner’s interest when a  buyout situation presents itself. Usually, the company gets the first  opportunity to purchase the interest in question, and

     then the continuing owners are allowed to purchase any of the transferring  owner’s interest that has not been purchased by the company, usually in  proportion to their current holdings.

     Probably the biggest advantage of this method is its flexibility.

     It allows the company and the continuing owners to make no decisions until a buyout situation comes up, at which point they can decide—considering tax consequences and the company’s and owners’ financial  circumstances—who will buy a transferring owner’s interest.

     For these reasons, in our agreement we use this third “wait and see”  approach. We believe it is best to allow the company and the continuing  owners to decide at the time of the buyout—and not when the buyout  agreement is drafted—who will buy a departing owner’s interest.

     While the “wait and see” buyback procedure works similarly for all three  types of buyout provisions discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 (the Right of  First Refusal, the Option to Purchase, and the Right to Force a Sale), a few different steps must be followed to implement

     

     it in each situation. Let’s take a brief look at each type of buyout situation.

     

     The “Wait and See” Approach Works

     By choosing the buyout provisions discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, you’ve already handled the details of *when* a buyout right or obligation is triggered. As a short review, this happens:

     - upon receipt of written notice that an owner intends to sell or transfer an  interest (in a Right-of-First-Refusal buyout situation)

     - upon the happening of an event that triggers a buyout right, such as an  owner’s retirement, disability, death, divorce, bankruptcy, loss of  license, or loan default (in an Option to Purchase an Owner’s Interest), or

     - upon receipt of a written notice to force a sale (in a Right-to- Force-a-Sale situation).

       You still need to learn about what happens *after* the buyout right or obligation is triggered. Let’s look at each type of buyout situation to see what the next steps are.

       

       How the Option to Purchase Works

       The procedure for the Option to Purchase an Owner’s Interest (Section IV,  (1) in our agreement) is triggered whenever notice is received by the  company of an option to purchase, whether it’s by a Notice of Intent to  Transfer according to a Right of First Refusal (Chapter 2) or notice of a business-disrupting event such as the retirement, divorce, disability,  or death of an owner (Chapter 3).

       Of course, in a small company, informal notice of departure or death  happens almost automatically and immediately, but notice of a divorce or bankruptcy may not occur until the ex-spouse of an owner or the  bankruptcy trustee gets hold of an ownership interest. But no matter how informally notice may be given, it’s important to understand that the  amount of time that the company has to decide

       

       whether to purchase (the “option period”) starts to tick only after the company knows that the triggering event has occurred. (For example, if the  company does not receive formal notice that an owner has filed for  bankruptcy, only when the company becomes aware of the bankruptcy does  the buyback right get triggered, and the option period starts to run.)

       

       Company’s Option to Purchase

       After the company receives notice, the company’s owners (or, in a  corporation, its board of directors and shareholders) should meet with  their tax advisers and each other to decide if it’s in their best  interest for the company itself to buy the available interest.

       It is up to you to decide on what a fair amount of time is for the company to make its decision, but we think 30 or 60 days is

       reasonable. (Remember, the continuing owners of the company then have another  period to decide individually whether they want to purchase the  available interest.) Of course, you can insert a longer time limit for  the company to decide to buy back the interest.

       CAUTION

       Allow adequate time for a buyback decision. For a high-stakes

       

       buyout, less than 30 or 60 days can be too short a time for a company to make  an informed decision with the help of a tax adviser.

       

       The language taken from the Option-to-Purchase provision in our buyout  agreement that covers this part of the procedure is shown below (see  Section IV, (1) of the agreement).

       Section IV: Buyout procedure

       1. Option of Company and Continuing Owners to Purchase an Interest
          1. This provision is triggered upon receipt of notice by the company according  to Section II or the notification of any of the events checked in  Section III where the company and/or the continuing owners have an  option, but not an obligation (unless otherwise stated in this  agreement), to purchase the interest that is the subject of the notice  (called the “available interest”).
          2. The company shall have an option to purchase any or all of the available interest within [*insert* *number of days, such as “30”*] days after the date on which the company receives notice or becomes aware of the event triggering the Option to Purchase.

       

       If the owners or directors decide that the company should buy all of the  available interest, the company must exercise its option by delivering a written Notice of Intent to Purchase to the transferring owner (or the  current holder of the interest) within the designated time period. (In  other words, the Notice of Intent to Purchase is sent to the  transferring, retiring, disabled, expelled, bankrupt, or defaulting  owner if the interest is still in the owner’s hands, or to the person  who now has ownership or control of the interest, such as a creditor, a  bankruptcy trustee, an estate representative, or the ex-spouse of an  owner.) The contents of the Notice of Intent to Purchase are covered  just below.

       

       Contents of Notice of Intent to Purchase

       Now, let’s look at the last few details of the buyback procedure contained in the buyout agreement.

       

       If the company or any of the continuing owners exercise their option to  buy the available interest, the company sends out a collective notice to the transferring owner, or the current holder of the interest,  regarding the company’s and/or continuing owners’ intent to purchase a  part or all the available interest (called a Notice of Intent to  Purchase).

       Generally, the Notice of Intent to Purchase should be sent to the person who  provided the original notice to the company of a proposed transfer or  the occurrence of any of the triggering events that give rise to a  buyback (the death, disability, or expulsion of an owner and the like).  For example, the Notice of Intent to Purchase the interest of a deceased owner will go to the representative of the deceased owner’s estate.

       The Notice of Intent to Purchase should include the following information:

   - the name and address of the company and the name and title of the officer  or employee who can be contacted at the company regarding the Notice of  Intent to Purchase

   - a description and the amount of ownership interest to be purchased by the company and/or each of the continuing owners and the name and address  of each such continuing owner

   - the total amount of the available interest to be purchased by the company and the continuing owners

   - the terms of the purchase according to the buyout agreement

   - a copy of the buyout agreement, and

   - if the interest to be purchased is represented by certificates, such as  share certificates, a request for the surrender of the share  certificates to the company.

Here’s an example of a straightforward Notice of Intent to Purchase, in letter format.

Continuing Owners’ Option to Purchase

If the company decides not to purchase all of the available interest, the  company must immediately let each of the continuing owners know that  some or all of the interest is available for purchase by



them (any part of the interest not purchased by the company). The continuing owners are given another time period (usually 30 or

60 days) following the expiration of the company’s option period to decide individually whether they want to purchase any of the interest not  purchased by the company. Again, it is up to you and

your co-owners to decide on what you think is a fair amount of time for the continuing owners to reach their decisions.

![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_089.gif)



1. If the company does not decide to purchase all of the available interest  within the time allowed, it shall immediately and, in all cases, no  later than the date of expiration of the company’s right to exercise its purchase option of the available interest, notify the continuing owners of their right to purchase the available interest not purchased by the  company. This notice by the company to the continuing owners shall  state:
   1. the amount and description of the interest available for purchase by the continuing owners
   2. the date by which the continuing owner must respond in writing to the  company that he or she wishes to purchase any or all of the available  interest, which date shall be [*insert* *number of days, such as "30"*] days after the date of the expiration of the company’s purchase option, and
   3. that any purchase by a continuing owner must be according to the terms of this buyout agreement.

A copy of this buyout agreement shall be immediately furnished to any continuing owner who requests a copy.



The language that covers this part of the procedure is shown below. It is  taken from the Option-to-Purchase provision in our buyout agreement.  (Section IV, (1).)

Within this second time period, each individual owner who wishes to purchase  any of the available interest must submit to the company a notice of how much of the interest he wants to buy.

![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_091.gif)



(d) Each continuing owner may exercise his or her option to purchase any or all of the available interest in writing by delivering or mailing to  the company an individual Notice of Intent to Purchase. This notice  shall be sent to the secretary or equivalent officer of the company, and shall show the name and address of the continuing owner who wishes to  purchase part or all of the available interest and the amount and a  description of the interest that the continuing owner wishes to  purchase.



The language that covers this part of the procedure is shown below. It is  taken from the Option-to-Purchase provision in our buyout agreement.  (Section IV, (1).)









Splitting the Interest Among the Owners

If only one continuing owner wants to individually purchase the available  interest, it’s simple—that owner simply purchases the interest in its  entirety.

The purchasing procedure can become a bit more involved if more than one of the continuing owners want to buy the available interest. Problems  develop when two or more continuing owners together wish to buy an  amount larger than the available interest being offered to the  continuing owners. When this occurs, the available interest must be  split up according to the terms set out in the buyout agreement.  Usually, the owner who currently owns the



largest percentage of the company gets to buy the lion’s share of the available interest.

Our agreement allows the owners who wish to purchase the available interest to buy in an amount relative to their ownership percentages within the  group of owners who elect to buy the interest (let’s call them “the  purchasing group”). In other words, an owner who wishes to purchase some of the available interest can buy as much of the interest as the  percentage she owns of the total amount currently owned by the  purchasing group. Note that this purchasing group excludes the  transferring owner’s interest or the interests of any owners who don’t  want to buy the newly available interest. The available interest is then divvied up to the purchasing owners based on those percentages.

Confused by all this legal terminology? Here are a couple of examples that  should help. First, here is an example that illustrates the allocation  of the available interest among shareholders.



exAMpLe: In Chapter 2, we introduced you to an adventure travel company called  Run-a-Muck, owned by Jason, Tim, Chris, and Bart. You may remember that  each of the four owners owns 250 shares of the corporation. Jason (the  transferring owner) gives the company notice of his intent to sell the  shares to an outsider (Austin). The company itself declines to exercise  its buyback option. Out of the three continuing owners of the company,  only Tim and Chris decide to purchase Jason’s shares as individual  owners. Together Tim and Chris (whose interests are pooled in computing  the total interest owned by the purchasing group) already own 500  shares. Since each of them owns half (250) of the total shares (500)  owned by the purchasing group, each is entitled to purchase half of  Jason’s shares, or 125 shares apiece. (Note that before purchasing  Jason’s shares, Tim and Chris were both 25% owners of the company—but  they nevertheless each were able to purchase 50% of Jason’s shares.)



Second, here is an example that illustrates the allocation of the available  interest among the owners of an LLC or a partnership.



exAMpLe: Janet, Spencer, Patti, and Stephen own a limited liability company called  Megasoft. Patti owns 45% of the company, Janet owns 25%, Spencer owns  15%, and Stephen owns 15%. Patti gets an offer from an outsider to buy  her 45% of the company, and she notifies the company of her intention to sell, attaching a copy of the offer to her notice. The directors of the corporation decide the corporation itself isn’t interested, but Janet  and Sherman, using their Right of First Refusal, want to buy as much of  Patti’s interest as they are allowed; Stephen, who needs every penny to  put his son through medical school, opts not to buy any.

Here’s how Janet and Spencer divide up the interest: Together, Janet and  Spencer (the purchasing group) own 40% (25% + 15%) of the company. Janet determines her ownership percentage of that total by dividing her  individual ownership percentage (25%) by the total owned by the group  (40%) to arrive at a percentage of 62.5%. Spencer divides his individual ownership percentage (15%) by the total (40%) to arrive at 37.5%.  Therefore, Janet will get 62.5% of Patti’s interest, and Spencer will  get 37.5%. (If you’re interested, after the buyout Janet ends up owning  53.125% of the company, Spencer 31.875%, and Stephen 15%.)

(e) If the total amount of interest specified in the notices by the  continuing owners to the company exceeds the amount of the interest  available for purchase by them, each continuing owner shall be entitled, up to the amount of interest specified in his or her individual Notice  of Intent to Purchase, to purchase a fraction of the available interest, in the same proportion that

the amount of the interest he or she currently owns bears to the total  amount of the company’s interest owned by all continuing owners electing to purchase.

1. If the company or any continuing owner exercises their option to purchase a part or all of the available interest, the company shall deliver or  mail to the current owner or, if different, the current holder of the  available interest, no later than five business days after the  expiration of the period to exercise their option to purchase the  available interest, a Notice of Intent to Purchase that includes the  following information:

   - the name and address of the company, and the name and title of the officer or employee who can be contacted at the company

   - a description and the amount of ownership interest to be purchased by the company and/or each of the continuing owners, and the name and address  of each such continuing owner

   - the total amount of the interest to be purchased by the company and the continuing owners

   - the terms of the purchase according to Section VII of this agreement

   - a copy of this agreement, and

   - if the interest to be purchased is represented by certificates, such as  share certificates, a request for the surrender of the share  certificates to the company.

     

     

     After mailing the notice of intent, the company and/or the continuing owners  buy back the interest according to the price and payment terms in the  agreement.

     (g) The company and the continuing owners shall purchase the portion or all of the available interest each has exercised an option to purchase in  the Notice of Intent to Purchase, according to the terms specified in  Section VII of this agreement, each making payment for the interest to  be purchased and complying with other terms as appropriate. The sale  shall be considered final when the company and the continuing owners  make payment

     to the owner or holder of the interest or, if payment is made over time, when all paperwork necessary to the sale has been

     executed by the company, the continuing owners, and the owner or holder of the interest to be purchased.

     

     The language that covers the final part of the procedure is shown below. It is taken from the Option-to-Purchase provision in our buyout agreement. (Section IV, (1).)

     

     

     

     How the Right of First Refusal Works

     As we discussed in Chapter 2, when an owner whose buyout agree- ment  contains a Right-of-First-Refusal clause receives an offer from an  outsider (or, sometimes, a current owner) to buy her ownership interest, the Right-of-First-Refusal clause is triggered. This clause says that,  before making a sale or transfer, the owner considering

     a sale or transfer must offer her interest to the company and to her  co-owners for purchase by delivering notice to the company of the terms  of the intended transfer (called a Notice of Intent to Transfer).

     The Notice of Intent to Transfer must include the price and payment terms  of the proposed sale and the name and address of the proposed buyer. A  copy of the offer from the proposed buyer must be attached. Here’s is a  sample of a simple notice:

     Jason Thomas proposes to sell 250 shares in Run-a-Muck to Austin Johnson, 113 Pine glen Drive, West greenwich, RI, within 60 days of the date of this notice for $2,500.00 cash ($10.00 per share).

     Payment of the purchase price by Austin Johnson is to be made in cash on the  date of the transfer. A copy of the offer to purchase these shares on  these terms, signed by Austin Johnson, is attached to this notice.

     

     At that point, the transaction unwinds just as if it arose under an  Option-to-Purchase clause—the company and the continuing owners now have an option to purchase the transferring owner’s interest if they choose. This part of the buyback procedure is the same under the  Right-of-First-Refusal provision as it is under an Option-to- Purchase  provision; see “How the Option to Purchase Works,” above, for an  explanation.

     The only significant difference between a regular Option to Purchase and  the option to purchase following a Right of First Refusal is in what  happens if neither the company nor the continuing owners buy all of the  interest at stake. If the company and the continuing owners decline to  buy *all* of the transferring owner’s interest, the transferring  owner is then free to sell her entire interest to the outsider or  current owner (or give her interest to a relative,

     if that’s what she was after) within 60 days, at the same price and terms  in her Notice of Intent to Transfer. On the other hand, if the company  or the continuing owners buy *all* of the transferring owner’s interest, the outsider or potential transferee is essentially shut out of the company.

     

     How a Right to Force a Sale Works

     The procedural details and agreement clauses that apply to a Right-  to-Force-a-Sale scenario, where the company and continuing owners are *required* to buy back an owner’s interest upon request (discussed in Chapter 3), are almost entirely the same as those discussed above for the  Option-to-Purchase procedure by the company and continuing owners. We  won’t explain each clause individually here; we’ll just point out the  few differences between the two procedures and the portions of the  agreement that need to be completed. Reread “How the Option to Purchase  Works,” above, if you have any additional questions about the forced  sale procedure or agreement language.

     First, forced sales may occur only in a few instances under our agreement: in  the case of the retirement, disability, or death of an owner. In these  instances, the retiring or disabled owner or, if an owner has died, his  or her family member, estate representative, or trustee can force a  buyout of the owner’s interest by submitting a Notice of Intent to Force a Sale. The contents of this notice under Section III of the agreement  vary, depending on the nature of the forced sale event (death,  disability, or retirement), but here’s a sample notice based upon an  owner’s retirement.

     Notice of Intent to Force a Sale

     Niall Carnahan requests that Olympic Parking, LLC, purchase all of his 50%  capital interest in Olympic Parking, LLC, due to his retirement from the company, effective October 10, 2010.

     Price and terms for payment shall be according to the buyout agreement dated  April 15, 2006, and on file with the company, a copy of which is  attached.

     

     A copy of the buyout agreement should be attached to the notice.

     

     Company’s Option to Purchase

     Once this notice is received by the company, first the company has a chance  to buy the interest of the retiring, disabled, or deceased owner under  the same procedure as that discussed in “How the Option to Purchase  Works,” above.

     You must decide how much time to give the company to make its buyback decision. We think 30 or 60 days is reasonable.

     1. Right to Force a Sale
        1. This provision is triggered upon receipt by the company of a Notice of  Intent to Force a Sale according to Section III, where the company and  the continuing owners have an obligation to purchase the interest that  is the subject of the notice (called the “available interest”).
        2. The company shall have an option to purchase any or all of the available interest within [*insert* *number of days, such as "30"*] days after the date on which the company receives the Notice of Intent to Force a Sale.

     

     The language that covers the first part of the procedure is shown below. It is taken from the Right-to-Force-a-Sale procedure in our buyout  agreement. (Section IV, (2).)

     Continuing Owner’s Option to Purchase

     If the company does not decide to buy all of the interest, the continuing  owners get a chance to buy any part of the interest not bought by the  company. As in the Option-to-Purchase procedure, a continuing owner who  wants to purchase any or all of the available interest must submit a  Notice of Intent to Purchase the interest within a specified time period (see “How the Option to Purchase Works,” above, for details). Again,  you must specify the period the continuing owners have to make their  buyback decision.

     1. If the company does not decide to purchase all of the available interest  within the time allowed, it shall immediately and, in all cases, no  later than the date of expiration of the company’s right to exercise its purchase option of the available interest, notify the continuing owners of their right to purchase the available interest not purchased by the  company. This notice by the company to the continuing owners shall  state:
        1. the amount and description of the interest available for purchase by the continuing owners
        2. the date by which the continuing owner must respond in writing to the  company that he or she wishes to purchase any or all of the available  interest, which date shall be [*insert* *number of days, such as "30"*] days after the date of the expiration of the company’s purchase option, and
        3. that any purchase by a continuing owner must be according to the terms of this agreement.

     A copy of this agreement shall be immediately furnished to any continuing owner who requests a copy.

     

     The language in our agreement that covers this part of the procedure is  shown below. It is taken from the Right-to-Force-a-Sale procedure in our buy-sell agreement. (Section IV, (2).)

Add to your worksheet the number of days that you want the continuing  owners to have (immediately after the expiration of the company’s period for making its purchase decision) to make their individual buyback  decisions under a Right to Force a Sale.

     Splitting the Interest Among Owners

     If more than one continuing owner is interested in purchasing the available interest, the continuing owners get to purchase the

     available interest in proportion to their current ownership holdings (see “How  the Option to Purchase Works,” above, for the mechanics of how this  allocation works among the continuing owners). If the continuing owners  do not buy all of the remaining interest available for purchase by them, the Right-to-Force-a-Sale procedure requires one very important extra  step. In this case, the company itself *must* purchase 100% of the  available interest not bought by the continuing owners, according to the price and payment terms in the agreement. Remember, in any forced sale  scenario under Section III of the agreement, the company or the  remaining owners are *required* to buy all of the retiring, disabled, or deceased owner’s interest if a forced sale is requested.

     (f) If the continuing owners decline to purchase all of the available interest that remains, the company *shall* purchase the amount of available interest not purchased by the continuing owners.

     don’t change the purchasing order of this procedure without

     

     a tax expert’s help. The order of the purchasing options is important for tax purposes—first the company has an option to purchase the transferring owner’s interest and then the continuing owners. If the total interest has not been  purchased or subscribed to at that point, the company must buy whatever  remains to be purchased.

     The company must then send out a consolidated Notice of Intent to Purchase  the interest to the owner or the owner’s estate, inheritors, guardian,  or whoever is forcing the sale. The entire interest is then purchased by the company and/or the continuing owners according to the terms in  Section VII of the agreement. ●

     ### I

     

     n Chapter 4, we discussed how a buyout will play out in the future. Now  you’ll need to adopt a sensible plan to provide the company or  continuing owners with funds to carry out a future

     buyout. If you don’t think about funding now, your buy-sell provisions may not  be able to help you later on (for example, if your company or co-owners  can’t come up with the money to buy out an owner’s estate after he has  died, his inheritors will be able to keep their ownership interest in  the company and may start to interfere).

     It is key to plan to fund a future buyout now, since some types of funding require long-term planning and accrual. In this chapter we briefly  discuss several common ways to fund a buyback under your buy-sell  agreement.

     

     Funding With Cash

     The most obvious way to pay for a buyout is with cash. Funding with cash is simple and has no immediate expense (unlike paying up-front premiums  for life insurance, which we discuss in “Buying Insurance,” below). But  unless your company or its owners are solidly solvent, planning to buy  back an owner’s interest with cash has a big downside. It requires that  your company or the continuing owners keep a large cash reserve  available at all times. And, of course, this ties up money (or the  ability to borrow it) that could better be used for other purposes.

     If neither the company nor the continuing owners have adequate cash  reserves when the time comes to buy out an owner or his family members,  the capital, or current income, of the company or the continuing owners’ personal savings could be seriously depleted. Or, in the worst-case  scenario, the buyback might not even happen.

     CAUTION

     corporations: Watch out for the accumulated earnings tax.

     

     For corporations, it’s even possible that holding a large cash reserve to  fund a future buyout could trigger an accumulated earnings tax penalty.  This tax

     

     is assessed when corporations hold on to earnings and profits that the IRS decides are not needed for normal business expansion or growth purposes (although most corporations get an automatic allowance to accumulate

     $250,000). Ask your tax adviser for more information.

     WORkSHEET

     turn to your worksheet. If you plan on funding a future buyout with cash only, you do not need to  check anything in Section V on your worksheet or in the buyout  agreement.

     

     Borrowing Money

     Borrowing money to fund a buyout is also fairly simple and does not require an  immediate outlay of cash, but this method has its obvious problems. At  the time of a buyout, the company or continuing owners might have  trouble getting a loan, especially if a co-owner has just died (since  the business has probably just lost an important asset).

     There are other problems with borrowing. The company may have already  exhausted its ability to borrow, or high interest rates may make getting a loan unaffordable.

     WORkSHEET

     turn to your worksheet. If you plan on funding a future buyout through company or personal loans,  you do not need to check anything in Section V on your worksheet or in  the buyout agreement.

     

     Buying Insurance

     Life insurance and disability insurance can play a big part in funding  buyouts. Not only can they fund buyouts in situations of the death or  disability of an owner, but in some cases they can also provide some  monies for the buyout of a retired owner (see “Life Insurance,” below).

     

     Here’s how insurance funding works: The company or the co- owners take out  insurance policies on each owner. When an owner dies or becomes  disabled, the insurance payoff is used to buy the departing owner’s  interest.

     Of course, some business owners do not like the idea of paying dollars up  front for a need that may be years away. But paying insurance premiums  can actually be cheaper than either saving or borrowing money. Plus,  having insurance is a guarantee that cash will be available to purchase  an owner’s interest.

     Insurance, however, cannot be used to fund a buyout that is triggered when an owner gets divorced, files for personal

     bankruptcy, loses a professional license, or defaults on a personal loan. For those buyout scenarios, cash, loans or other types of funding must be used.

     

     Who Pays the Insurance Premiums?

     There are two alternatives here: The company buys and owns policies on each  owner or each owner buys and owns policies on each of the co-owners.

     

     Company Pays Premiums

     One approach is to have the company pay the premiums on an insurance policy for each owner, with the company being the owner and beneficiary of  each policy. When an owner dies or becomes disabled, the company uses  the insurance policy payoff to buy the ownership interest of the owner.  This is called “entity purchase,” or “company-purchased,” life  insurance.

     

     exAMpLe: A company has three owners. They adopt a buy- sell agreement calling for  the company to buy out the estate of a deceased owner under an entity  purchase arrangement. The company buys three insurance policies, which  insure the lives of each of the three owners. The face amount of each  policy

     

     is enough to add up to the full Agreement Price for the entire company (or at least will come close enough).

     

     This approach is simple and cheap—only one policy is needed on each owner  (rather than several, as is necessary when the owners purchase the  policies themselves—discussed next).

     

     Owners Pay Premiums

     Another approach is for each owner to individually purchase and pay for  insurance policies on the lives of each of their co-owners— this is  called “cross-purchase,” or “owner-purchased,” life insurance. The  individual owners pay the premiums, own the policies, and receive the  insurance benefits if there’s a payout.

     In a three-owner company, the face amount of a policy on another owner  should be high enough to pay for half of the purchase price of the  owner’s interest.

     

     exAMpLe: Jackie, Elizabeth, and Graciela open a photography studio, to be operated as a  partnership. They adopt a buy- sell agreement calling for the continuing owners to buy out a

     disabled owner with disability insurance, under a cross-purchase arrangement.  Under the buy-sell agreement, each person’s share of the company is  worth approximately $100,000. Jackie buys two disability insurance  policies: one on Elizabeth for $50,000 and one on Graciela for $50,000.  Elizabeth also buys two policies for $50,000: one on Jackie and one on  Graciela. And, of course, Graciela buys two policies for the same  amount: one on Jackie and one on Elizabeth. Jackie suffers a chronic  disability from long-term exposure to developing chemicals, and their  disability insurance company rules that she is permanently and totally  disabled. After the required six-month waiting period goes by, Elizabeth and Graciela each purchase half of Jackie’s interest with the $50,000  disability insurance payout they each receive from the insurance  company.

     

     Cross-purchase arrangements require more paperwork and more premiums (more policies)  and are more difficult to maintain than a company-purchased insurance  arrangement, especially for companies with more than a few owners. Also, paying for several smaller policies (required by a cross-purchase  insurance plan) is sometimes more expensive than paying for one larger  policy (under an entity purchase plan). Therefore, in businesses with  more than two or  three owners, entity purchased insurance may be the  way to go.

     There are many other factors involved in choosing between entity purchase and cross-purchase insurance, but we can make a few observations here. If  you expect your company, not the

     continuing owners, to exercise buyback rights when it comes time  to buy out an  owner under your agreement, it makes sense to opt for entity purchase  insurance in your agreement. On the other hand, if you expect the  continuing owners to buy out ownership interests under your agreement,  you would probably be best choosing the cross-purchase insurance option.

     Of course, if you don’t know whether the company or the continuing owners  will buy out a departing owner, or you expect both the company and  continuing owners to effectuate buyouts under your agreement, either  type may make sense. But, in this case, we believe it’s best to choose  the entity purchase option. Again, having the company purchase one  policy on each owner can be simpler and less expensive than having  three, four, or more owners purchase a policy on each of their  co-owners.

     But what happens if the continuing owners want to exercise their option to  buy a deceased owner’s interest, and your agreement calls for  company-purchased insurance? In small businesses where all of the owners participate, the company can always make loans to the continuing owners to purchase the available interest, and then use the cash from its  insurance payout to increase the owners’ bonuses and salaries to allow  them to make their loan payments to the company.

     There are disadvantages to entity purchase life insurance. Since

     

     the policies are company assets under this scheme, the cash values of the  policies are subject to the claims of business creditors. Also, for  corporations, the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) may trigger an income tax when proceeds are paid out. To avoid tax problems, you  should see a tax adviser to discuss these issues before having your  company purchase life insurance policies on the owners’ lives.

     CAUTION

     There are disadvantages to cross-purchase life insurance.

     

     Younger owners, who are usually in the weakest financial position to pay high  life insurance premiums, bear the burden of paying higher premiums for  older owners. In addition, cross-purchase insurance may not be the ideal choice for corporations. If the corporate tax rate is lower than the  individual owners’ marginal tax rates, it will be cheaper for the  company to pay for premiums than for the individual owners (the  after-tax cost will be lower). Investigate these financial issues with  your insurance agent and your tax adviser before going ahead with a  cross-purchase insurance plan.

     

     Life Insurance

     In this section, we touch on a few things you should understand if you’re  interested in funding your buyout agreement with life insurance.  However, most of your planning in this area will be

     done with an insurance agent or broker (one who must be familiar with  buy-sell agreements and small businesses) and/or a qualified financial  planner or CPA.

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_114.png)

     CAUTION

     not everyone can get life insurance. Life insurance may not be

     

     available to owners of advancing years or who have ill health. If this describes  you or your co-owners, you’ll have to consider other funding methods,  such as accumulating cash reserves and/or borrowing money. Also, see  “Making Installment Payments,” below.

     

     

     When a sole proprietor dies, her business may die with her unless other  steps are taken. If there is a family member who is willing and able to  take over, the owner can leave the business to that person as a gift.

     But often an owner doesn’t have the option of giving the business to family members or relatives. In that case, the owner may want to sell the  business to a key employee who is willing and able to take over.

     To fund an employee buyout of a sole owner, the employee can purchase an  insurance policy on the life of the owner. The employee is the owner,  the payer of premiums, and the beneficiary of the policy.

     When the owner dies, the insurance proceeds will be used to buy the business from the owner’s estate (and the proceeds will then go to the sole  proprietor’s inheritors). In case an owner retires (instead of dying),  the cash value of the insurance (if a whole life policy is purchased)  can be used by the employee to make a down payment toward purchase of  the owner’s interest.

     

     Employee Buyouts

     

     Here are some key points you should know when shopping for life insurance:

     purchase policies now. Ideally, life insurance policies should be purchased at the same time you create a buy-sell agreement. That’s because the cost of premiums will only go  up as owners get older. You should estimate the amount you’ll need for a buyout, and then get life insurance policies for a little more than  that amount. Also, the face amounts of life insurance policies should be scheduled to keep up with the value of the owners’ interests.

     Increase insurance regularly. After the buyout of another owner, the value of the remaining owners’ interests will increase.

     Unfortunately, increasing the policy amounts at that point could be costly. But with  some policies, policy dividends can be applied to purchase additional  one-year term insurance. In this way you can automatically keep  increasing the amount of life insurance held.

     

     Make sure to ask your insurance agent or broker about this type of insurance.

     Investigate specialized policies. A variety of alternatives to standard life insurance policies exist that  should be discussed with your insurance agent or broker prior to  deciding on the best way to fund the buyout of deceased owners. For  example, some insurance companies now offer a less-expensive “first to  die” life

     insurance policy that pays when the first of two or more individuals dies.  Another alternative is the “adjustable life” policy, whose

     payoff amount can be increased (with a corresponding increase in premiums)  during the life of the policy. As your business becomes more valuable,  you can increase the death benefit payable under this type of policy.

     consider the benefits of whole life insurance. Not only can life insurance policies fund buyouts after the death of an  owner, but some types of life insurance can also help to fund a buyout  during an owner’s lifetime (or at least provide a down payment for a  buyout). In this type of arrangement, the company or the

     owners take out whole life insurance policies in the name of each owner, which build up cash surrender values. If an owner retires or becomes  disabled, the company or the continuing owners can cash out the policies they hold on the life of the departing owner and give the cash  surrender value of the policies to him in exchange for his ownership  interest. If the cash surrender value of the policies

     is less than the buyback price (which it probably will be), then the  company or the owners must pay the difference or sign one or more  promissory notes to cover what remains of the purchase price, plus  interest, until it is paid off.

     understand the tax consequences. Here are the normal income tax consequences of buyback arrangements funded by life insurance:

     - The purchasers of the insurance (the company or the owners) get no income tax deduction for the amount of the premiums paid.
     - Premiums paid by the company or co-owners for a policy on the life of an owner will not be taxable to the insured owner.



- Life insurance proceeds paid to the policy owners (the company or the  continuing owners) are generally not subject to income tax. The owners  or the company do not have to report the funds as income; the funds are  simply used to buy the ownership interest back, usually from a deceased  owner’s estate.

- Life insurance proceeds will not be included in the estate of a deceased  owner for estate tax purposes as long as  the proceeds are not payable  directly to the estate and the deceased owner did not own the policy  (see “Avoid Estate Taxes on Life Insurance Payouts,” below). Policy  proceeds

  should be payable to the company or the continuing owners, whoever held the policy.

  CAUTION

  Set buyout price independent of insurance. We don’t think it’s

  

  smart to tie the price to be paid for an ownership interest to the payoff  value of the insurance taken out. A big reason for this is that the  insurance policies may not be updated to reflect increased earnings of  the company. In such cases,

  the buyout price set by the insurance policy will probably be unfairly low. Also, agreements that have an insurance policy fix the buyout price  will not fix the value of an ownership interest for estate tax purposes  (see Chapter 9).

  Our approach is to have the buy-sell agreement set a buyout price  independent of the means used to fund the buyout. Of course, your  company can still fully fund a buyout with insurance proceeds by  regularly updating the policies regularly to reflect any increase in the value of the ownership interest.

  Avoid Estate Taxes on Life Insurance Payouts

  To ensure that the proceeds of life insurance are not included in a  deceased owner’s estate for estate tax purposes, make sure that each  insured owner has no “incidents of ownership” in the policy on his life  and that the policy proceeds will not be directly available to the  owner’s estate or inheritors to pay taxes or estate debts. (However, the company or continuing owners can buy the interest from the deceased  owner’s estate or inheritors with the life insurance proceeds, and the  estate or inheritors could then use the proceeds to pay taxes or estate  debts.)

  If the policy provisions or your buy-sell agreement gives the insured  owner an option to purchase the policy prior to death (for example, upon termination of the buy-sell agreement or cancellation of the policies  by the corporation), the IRS may decide that the owners have been given  “incidents of ownership” in the policies. If so, the insurance proceeds  may be included in a deceased owner’s taxable estate (even if the  deceased owner never exercised her option to take title to the policy  prior to her death). Our agreement does *not* provide an owner with the option to purchase the insurance policies that the company or owners hold on his life.

  There’s also a special estate tax trap to watch out for when the owners  individually take out policies on the lives of each other. Namely, when

  an owner dies, if your arrangement requires his estate to transfer the  insurance policies he owned on the lives of the surviving owners back to the surviving owners, the IRS might consider this arrangement a  “transfer for value” feature of these policies. In this case, life  insurance proceeds paid upon an owner’s death would be taxable as part  of her estate. Our agreement does *not* require an owner’s estate to transfer the policies back to the surviving owners.

  Without going further into the ins and outs of these special rules, one bit of  advice: You will want your insurance or tax adviser to scrutinize any  life insurance arrangement you adopt to make sure that insurance  proceeds will not be included in the taxable estate of a deceased owner. See Chapter 9 for more on estate tax issues.

  

  Disability Insurance

  One way to handle funding the buyout of a disabled owner is to have your  buyout agreement require the purchase of disability insurance on all  co-owners. This way, if a disability occurs, the insurance policy  proceeds can provide a source of funds to allow the company or the  continuing co-owners to buy back the interest of a disabled  owner—without diminishing company or personal cash reserves or having to borrow.

  Some disability policies are designed to fund buyouts under buy-sell  agreements. These policies usually pay a lump-sum cash benefit of up to  $1 million to fund the buyout of a disabled owner. If desired,  additional financial benefits can be funded by policy proceeds, such as a wage continuation plan to the disabled owner (prior to a buyout of  ownership interest). Be sure to ask your insurance agent or broker about these special policies.

  Disability insurance operates in much the same way that life insurance does to  provide funds to buy out a deceased owner’s ownership interest. Much of  the information we covered in the life insurance discussion above  applies here also. In addition, there are several issues specific to  disability insurance to be aware of:

- definition of disability. If you choose to purchase disability insurance, our agreement uses your  insurance company’s definition of “total disability” and provides that  the insurance company is the arbiter of whether the co-owner is totally  disabled—that is, the insurance company decides whether an owner’s  disability will trigger a buyout under your buyout agreement. (In the  agreement, see Section III, Scenario 2, When an Owner Becomes Disabled).

- Waiting period. As covered in chapter 3, our agreement establishes a period of time—an  “elimination period”—that an owner’s inability to work for the company  must persist before a buyout can occur. The length of this waiting  period

  

  should be dictated by the insurance policy. (See Section III, Scenario 2.)

  - date of valuation. As covered in Chapter 3, you need to specify *when* the buyout price will be determined. Most companies use the date the owner  stopped working as the date to value the business—since that is the date the

    owner stopped contributing to the company. This way, any changes in the worth of the company can be attributed to the remaining owners. (See Section  III, Scenario 2.) You can, however, have the buyout price be determined  on the date of the buyout.

  - policy payout. Your disability insurance policy can provide just a down payment to buy a  disabled owner’s interest, or it can be set up to provide the entire  purchase price. However, the insurance company will likely pay only up  to the amount of the buyout—essentially, you’ll lose any policy benefit

in excess of the buyout price. In addition, your insurance policy can be  set up to pay off either a lump-sum payment or a series of payments.  Your insurance agent should review your agreement to make sure that it  is not in conflict with your insurance policy regarding payment terms,  price, and elimination period.

The disability funding clauses we use in our agreement (Section V, (2)) are shown below.

   TIP

   Life insurance can partially fund the buyout of a disabled

   

   owner. Some types of life insurance (for example, whole life) can help to fund a  buyout of a disabled owner by providing cash surrender values. If an  owner becomes disabled, the company or the continuing owners can cash  out the policies they hold on the life of the disabled owner and give  the cash surrender value of the policies to her (plus some cash—up to  the Agreement Price) in exchange for her ownership interest. Ask your  insurance agent or broker about this possibility.

   

   Making Installment Payments

   Another way to ease the financial burden of future buyouts is to allow the  buyer to pay the purchase price, or at least part of it, over time. Your buyout agreement can provide that payment for an owner’s interest will  be made by the company or the continuing owners in installments, perhaps over three to five years. This way, the installment payments to the  departing owner come from cash

   flow that is generated after the departing owner leaves the business, which  means the company may not have to build up cash reserves or borrow money to fund a company buyout. (Installment plans are discussed in Chapter  7.)

   To pay for the installment payments made by the company to the departing  owner, the continuing owners could decrease their salaries or  distributions. Or, if the continuing owners buy out the departing  owner’s interest, they might take more of the company’s cash flow

   in salary or distributions to pay for the installment payments (of course, they will owe income taxes on this money). However, when continuing  owners (or family members or key employees) buy out a departing owner,  often the only cash source available to them— outside of loans—is the  future cash flow of the business.

   However, receiving payments in dribs and drabs can be incon- venient for the  departing owner or his family members, especially if they don’t have  confidence in the abilities of the remaining owners to successfully  continue the business in the meantime. Also, if a company has to pay the entire purchase price in installments, the drain on future cash flow  might not allow the continuing owners to maintain their business and  salaries or distributions comfortably. For these reasons, if you choose  to set up installment payments, you’ll also probably want to provide  that some portion of the purchase price will be paid up front, either  with cash reserves, a loan, or the purchase of insurance (discussed  above). ●

   ### B

   

   y now, you should have your eye on the buyout provisions that will best  handle prospective ownership changes for your company. Also, after  reading Chapters 4 and 5, you should

   understand how buyout procedures work and how you might fund a future buyout. Now, as explained in this chapter, your next big job is to decide how to  establish a fair price for any future buybacks or buyouts that occur.  (The standard price for all buyouts is referred to here as “Agreement  Price.”)

   Unfortunately, choosing a price that will be perceived years from now—by all owners  and the IRS—as representing the true value of your company is no easy  task. After all, as you read this, you can’t know if in the years ahead  your business will prosper mightily, struggle to make a profit, or fail.

   

   Why Choose a Price in Advance?

   Even with a pile of up-to-date facts, coming up with an accurate price for a small, privately owned business interest is not easy. For one thing,  unlike publicly traded corporations, there is no public market for small business interests, so it’s hard to establish

   comparative prices for similar businesses. And even if you are able to find out how much similar businesses are selling for, there’s no guarantee yours  would fetch a similar price. Depending on the economy and competitive  pressures in your industry, as well as the health (or lack thereof) of  your business, plus many other more subtle factors, the true value of  your company could be much more or much less.

   Although it is hard to value an interest in a small business, and even harder to do it years in advance of a sale, it’s a job that must be done in order to prepare an adequate buyout agreement. If owners neglect to do this,  they might end up arguing over price any time an owner’s interest is  bought under the buyout agreement. And if the

   

   divorce or death of an owner is the reason for a buyout, negotiations would  almost surely be burdened by the emotions of the owner’s spouse,  inheritors, or estate representative, making agreement over price  difficult or impossible. Especially when a divorce is involved, such  emotion-laden conflict can result in a lawsuit.

   Should a co-owner die, her inheritors can find themselves at a truly unfair disadvantage in the absence of an agreement. For

   instance, a recently widowed spouse who needs cash to pay a child’s college  tuition may be easily pressured into selling her ownership interest back to the company or the remaining owners at a too-low price (or a spouse  may simply not be familiar with the business and, as a result, not know  what a fair price for the interest is).

   While no price or formula will be perfect, choosing one in advance does have  the great advantage of allowing you and your co-owners a chance to think about, discuss, and vote on how a reasonable price for the company  should be calculated, at a time when none of you are planning to sell  out. Just the fact that a particular method was agreed to by all owners  is likely to go a long way toward reducing conflict when you or a  co-owner leaves. Even if, at the time of an owner’s departure, you all  agree to modify

   the Agreement Price to better reflect current realities, the fact that you  start with an agreement—not a vacuum—should make the negotiating process easier. Fortunately, there are some techniques that can help you come  up with a fair price. Let’s look at how they work.

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_122.png)

   TIP

   It may be easier to establish a price in advance. Think of it this

   

   way: When you’re creating your buyout agreement, no owner knows who will  leave first. So even though it’s hard to agree on a future price for a  new or growing business, making this decision before any owner leaves  has huge advantages.

   

   

   One reason to set a price or formula in advance concerns “estate  taxes”—taxes collected after your death by the government. Carefully  setting a price for estate tax purposes can potentially save your estate a lot of dough (assuming the estate tax exists when you die)—which is  important if your heirs want to hang on to the business interest they  inherit. A good valuation provision can fix the value of your ownership  interest at an amount considerably lower than its market value at the  time of your death. (And the lower the value your agreement provides,

   the lower your estate taxes.) Of course, to really save a bundle on estate  taxes, the IRS must accept the value set in your buy-sell agreement. The key to getting the IRS to accept it is choosing the right valuation  method. We discuss estate taxes in “Estate Tax Issues” in Chapter 9.

   

   Your Buyout Agreement and Estate Taxes

   

   What Valuation Methods Are Based On

   Sometimes new owners imagine that, if they were to leave their company after a  few months or years, they’d get back exactly the money they invested  (often called their capital contribution—see “Capital Accounts,” below). This is rarely appropriate. Instead, a departing owner should get more  than the initial investment if the business does well and less (possibly even nothing) if it does badly. After all, the point of investing is to make a gain, which, of course, means that you also have to take the  risk of taking a loss.

   

   Assets Versus Liabilities

   The value of a new business is often closely tied to the net value of its  assets (that is, the current fair market value of the company assets  minus company liabilities).

   

   exAMpLe: Carol and Dick go into business together to clean and repair houses before the houses go on the real estate

   

   market. Carol plans on doing industrial-strength cleaning, interior painting,  and yard work, while Dick will take care of any needed exterior  painting, critical repairs, and, if called for,

   minor structural improvements. Each puts up $20,000 as a capital contribution.

   Their first decision is to purchase a van. Rather than looking into the used  van market, however, they buy a new vehicle from a dealer for almost  $35,000 and have their company name, “Property Moppers,” painted on the  side. Dick also buys a high- powered washer, a power painter, and a set  of tools for a total of $4,500. Carol buys what seems like a year’s  worth of cleaning supplies and paintbrushes for $500.

   Six months into it, Property Moppers has had only three jobs, and, because  of their inexperience, Dick and Carol spent more to fix up the houses  than they were paid. Carol, knowing that it takes time to build a  business reputation and get a system down, vows to hang in there. Dick,  however, has no patience and tells Carol he already wants out. He  demands that Carol pay him the $20,000 he put into the company. Carol  can’t afford to buy out Dick without taking out a home equity loan,  something she is loathe to do—at least before she finds someone to do  Dick’s work. Fearing she may just have to give up the business and sell  the equipment, she tries to make a deal with Dick.

   Eventually, they agree to have an appraiser value the current worth of their  business assets, with Dick accepting half of that amount for his share.

   The appraisal is straightforward. Since Dick and Carol didn’t buy anything  on credit, the business has no liabilities. Since they don’t have any  customers, the business has no “goodwill.” In short, the business is  worth the current value of its assets.

   Although they bought the van for $35,000, the appraiser concludes it has already dropped in value by $10,000. Similarly, although they paid $4,500 for  the tools new, the appraiser decides that their current market value is  less than half that—

   $2,000. Finally, the appraiser sets the market value of Carol’s remaining  cleaning supplies at $20. Adding all the assets up, the

   

   appraiser values Property Moppers at $27,000, or $13,000 less than the sum of the owners’ capital contributions! Under their agreement, Dick must accept  half of that—$13,500—rather than his original $20,000 contribution.

   

   In short, because the value of a company goes up and down depending on the success or failure of the business, most valuation formulas do not use  capital contributions as the basis for a buyback price, but instead use  information on sales, profits, or assets to come up with the current  worth of the company.

   

   Capital Accounts

   The term capital account refers to the dollar value of a partner’s or LLC  member’s interest in the business (not counting depreciation or  goodwill). An owner’s capital account starts off with the value of her  initial investment in the business (her capital contribution).

   Accounting additions and subtractions occur over time as the profits and losses of the company are recorded and as additional capital contributions or  distributions are made.

   Sometimes the value of these capital accounts is used as the basis for setting  the amount each owner gets if the company ceases to do business and  liquidates its assets (“dissolves”). Thus, if a business dissolves in a  situation where all creditors of the business have been fully paid off  and there’s still money left in the business, each owner may be able to  be paid back his capital investment. If there is insufficient cash left  from a liquidated business to pay each owner the amount in his capital  account, the relative percentage of each owner’s capital account will be used to split whatever cash is left from the liquidated business (for  example, a 50% owner should get 50% of the net cash of a liquidated  business).

   Since the value of capital accounts usually bears little relationship to the  real worth of a business, our buyout agreement does not use capital  accounts to put a price on ownership interests for buyouts and buybacks.

   

   

   It’s fairly common for an owner’s spouse or children or other relatives to  object when a company eventually asserts its right to buy back the  shares of a deceased, disabled, or divorced owner. Often, these family  members have an unrealistically high expectation of the value of the  company and are upset if the amount they will receive in a buyout is  based on a conservative valuation formula.

   Trouble of this sort is particularly likely when key family members have been  kept in the dark about the terms of a buyout agreement. It follows that  you can defuse most potential future problems by making sure that  spouses, adult children, and any other family members likely to be  affected by a future buyout clearly understand the valuation method  described in your buyout agreement. At a minimum, make sure that the  spouses of all owners read and sign your buyout agreement (we provide a  specific spousal consent provision at the end of our agreement, to be  signed by spouses).

   

   Explain Provisions to Family Members

   

   How Our Valuation Provisions Work

   Throughout this book and in our buyout agreement itself, we refer to the price or formula you choose in your agreement as the

   Agreement Price. This price, which represents the value of the entire business,  applies to most transfers under the buyout agreement. The Agreement  Price can be updated at any time.

   

   When the Agreement Price Applies

   The Agreement Price will usually control whenever the company or the  continuing owners buy an ownership interest, no matter why the buyout  was triggered—death, retirement, divorce, disability, or any other  reason listed in the agreement.

   However, one part of your agreement may include a buyout pro- vision that uses a different price. For instance, a Right-of-First-Refusal

   

   provision may require the company and the continuing owners to match the price an outsider has offered for an owner’s interest,

   rather than the Agreement Price (as discussed in Chapter 2). If so, the  outsider’s price will take precedence over the general Agree- ment  Price.

   You might have provided that the full Agreement Price is not to be used, or is to be discounted, in other buyout situations as

   well. For example, as discussed in Chapter 3, your agreement might state that a co-owner who wants out in the first year or two may be eligible to  receive only a fraction of the Agreement Price.

   

   The Price of an Individual Owner’s Interest

   For purposes of convenience, the price provisions in our buyout agreement  set an Agreement Price that reflects the worth of the whole company. To  come up with a price for any individual owner’s interest, simply  multiply the entire Agreement Price by that owner’s ownership  percentage. For example, if an owner owns 25% of his company, you’d  multiply the Agreement Price by 25% to come up with the price of that  owner’s share.

   

   Choosing a Valuation Provision

   Our buyout agreement sets out five alternative valuation provisions. We  discuss each below. Once you decide on the one you want, simply check  the appropriate box in your agreement.

   

   Updating the Valuation Provision

   Having all the valuation provisions in your buyout agreement allows you to  easily update your method of valuation should the need arise, without  having to create a whole new agreement. Once you’ve been in business at  least two or three years, you might want to choose a more complex  valuation formula than you initially chose (for instance, a formula  based on earnings rather than assets). Also, any time the type of  business you run changes (for instance, your

   

   company changes from a products and service company to one that sells only products), you should revisit your valuation clause.

   To change your valuation method at a later date, you can simply line-out  your check mark for the valuation method you originally chose and place a new check mark in front of a different valuation alternative. You will  want to date and have each owner initial each line-out and addition to  your agreement. Or, if you saved it on your computer, you can just  change your choice in the agreement and print out a clean copy for  signature by the owners.

   

   Agreeing on a Fixed Price (Valuation Method 1)

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_123.png)

   TIP

   using a fixed price may not be the best method. For a number

   

   of reasons, which we discuss below, adopting a valuation formula is often, but not always, a better approach than actually inserting a fixed price in your

   buyout agreement. In short, before getting enthusiastic about the first—or any other—valuation alternative, please read this entire chapter.

   

   The most straightforward approach to nailing down a buyout price for your  agreement is to agree upon an actual fixed-dollar price in your buyout  agreement.

   Advantages. The agreed-value, or fixed-price, method combines simplicity with  certainty. By setting a fixed-dollar value yourself, there is no need to bother with appraisals, accountants, or earnings multiples when an  owner’s interest is being purchased. You simply take your buyout  agreement out of its file, blow off the dust, and locate the fixed price in Section VI, Agreement Price.

   The fixed-price method also gives a clear picture to the owners of what the future holds—specifically, how much they can expect to walk away from  the company with. It also makes it easier for business owners to do  estate planning, since they know exactly what the agreed value of their  ownership interests will be when they die,

   

   and how much their estate might owe in estate taxes, if any. A fixed price  also lets owners know how much life or disability insurance they need to buy.

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_124.png)

   TIP

   don’t tie the payment to insurance proceeds. Your buyout

   

   agreement should not call for a lump-sum payment that is tied specifically to the amount of life or disability insurance proceeds (see the warning “Set  buyout price independent of insurance,” in Chapter 5, for reasons why).  Our approach is to have the buyout agreement set a buyback price  independent of the means used to fund the buyout.

   

   disadvantages. Pinpointing a fixed price as the true value of your company can be a difficult  task. Using the fixed-price method requires that the owners have  business acumen, or at least informed common sense, when it comes to  valuing their company.

   The major problem with establishing a fixed price in advance is that any value you pick for your business will almost surely be

   quickly outdated. Depending on your initial outlook and your actual success or  failure, your fixed price should be adjusted up or down  to keep pace  with business profitability and owner expectations.

   And after several years of profitable operations, it may make sense to  place a value on the ability of the company to draw customers or attract business (called “goodwill”). For example, a small architecture company that specializes in public safety buildings (police, fire,

   and emergency response) may, over the years, build up a valuable reputation that will help bring in a steady stream of profitable new jobs, thereby increasing the value of the company.

   It follows that if you use the fixed-price method, you should periodically revise your agreement. We recommend that you make annual updates to  change the agreed value shown in your agreement.

   You can regularly update the fixed price either by preparing and signing a new agreement with a new value or by signing a

   

   separate statement. If you use separate statements to update your agreed value,  make sure to attach copies to your buyout agreement for future  reference. (See Chapter 8 for more on updating your agreement.)

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_125.png)

   TIP

   revisit the fixed price regularly. Even if you plan to annually

   

   update your company’s agreed value, there is always the danger that this task  will be overlooked. Although it’s not an adequate substitute for meeting and agreeing on a new price, some co-owners include a backup clause in  their agreement that will automatically adjust the Agreement Price up or down based on the consumer price index or another inflation-tracking  mechanism in any year when the co-owners fail to update it.

   

   As you can see, there are can be problems with using a fixed- price, or  agreed-value, provision. Because it’s usually subjective—and often out  of date—a fixed price can create arguments between the buyer of an  owner’s interest (the company or the continuing owners) and the seller  (a departing owner or his spouse, his inheritors, or

   an estate representative). Its subjectivity and unreliability may even  subject a fixed price to a court challenge by a departing owner or  inheritor, and a judge may refuse to uphold it without real data to back it up.

   Because of these drawbacks, the fixed-price method is less popular than several of the other methods discussed below, although it is sometimes used to  set a low value for a new or small service business, at least until the  business has been in operation long enough to make it sensible for the  owners to switch to one of the other methods (see “Businesses Where an  Agreed-Upon Price May Work,” below).

   If you do decide to use the fixed-price method, there are a few steps you  can take to protect the company. First, be conservative when setting a  value for your business. We all hope to be hugely successful, but few of us will really become multimillionaires because of small business  ownership. Recognizing this, when

   

   you prepare your buyout agreement, it’s wise to resist galloping optimism.  Also consider that, although you will want to be paid a high price for  your business interest if you will be the first to

   leave, the tables are turned if you and your co-owners must buy out someone  else. If your business is highly overvalued, it might even have to be  liquidated to pay off a departing owner.

   Section VI: Agreement price

   unless otherwise provided in this agreement, the undersigned agree that the  method checked below for valuing the company shall be used to determine a price for ownership interests under this agreement.

   n Valuation Method 1: Agreed Value

   The agreed value of the company shall be $ [insert agreed-upon price for entire company, such as "100,000"], or such other amount as fixed by all owners of the company after the  date of adoption of this agreement as specified in a written statement  signed by each owner of the company. If more than one such statement is  signed by the owners after the date of adoption of this agreement, the  statement with the latest date shall control for purposes

   of fixing a price for the purchase of ownership interests under this  agreement. The value of an individual owner’s interest shall be the  entire value for the company as determined under this paragraph,  multiplied by his or her ownership percentage.

   

   The language of the agreed-value provision in our buyout agreement is shown below.

   Businesses Where an Agreed-Upon Price May Work

   In some companies, an agreed-on price may be a simple and efficient way to provide for how much a business is worth.

   - Service businesses. From computer repairs to cutting hair, new service businesses typically have few valuable assets beyond the energies and hopes of their owners. In  this context, rather than bothering with trying to determine the worth  of the business by more conventional means (for instance, book value,  capitalization of earnings, appraisal), the owners may simply agree on  what

     they think the business is worth and revise this figure periodically. Later, if the business grows and succeeds, they may wish to switch to one of  the other valuation methods.

   - closely held companies with just a few owners. Another occasion where it may be appropriate to use the agreed-value method is  for small, closely held companies where the owners want to maintain  close, harmonious relationships. Since the price is set in advance, an  individual being bought out is less likely to become paranoid and  conclude that the company is manipulating a last-minute valuation  process in order to establish an artificially low buyout value. And by  establishing the buyout price in the agreement at a reasonably  conservative figure—something that owners in smaller companies are  likely to do—the company should be able to afford a buyout when the time comes to implement one.

   - companies in their first year. Choosing a conservative fixed price that all owners agree on is a simple way to  provide an Agreement Price for the first year of business. This can be  helpful if you try to obtain insurance funding in the first year (see  Chapter 5). Many insurance companies won’t cover a company in its first  year, but some will for a low fixed price of, say, $100,000 or $250,000.



Using a Buyout Formula

Because valuing a business interest that will be sold in a future transaction  is so difficult, using a valuation formula based on numbers such as the  value of current assets, the level of sales, or the amount of profit can make a lot of sense. Because formulas use regularly updated, factual  information, they tend to give a more accurate picture of your company’s worth than using a fixed price. The trick is choosing the one of a half dozen or so common valuation methods that best represents the value of  your company.

Start by understanding that some valuation methods are more appropriate for  certain businesses than others. For instance, for a company that exists  only to own real estate, it would make more sense to establish its worth by appraising the fair market value of its assets (the buildings and  land it owns) and then subtracting its liabilities (the mortgages it  owes on), rather than trying to value it based on a multiple of yearly  earnings.

On the other hand, an assets-based method would work poorly for a small, organic honey company that has been profitably

producing and marketing high-grade honey for the last fifteen years.

While the company’s only assets might be a few boxes of bees and some mesh  jumpsuits and smoke guns, valuing it based on its earnings history would surely be more appropriate.

Small service businesses are in a category all their own. Most

of the value of these companies is tied up in the owners’ hard work and  their customers’ personal goodwill toward them. If a service business’s  major asset consists of a customer or client list, and an owner who  departs will likely take most of her own customers with her, there may  be little value left in the business. In that case, the departing owner  should be paid for little beyond any company

assets and equipment. This is true for most service businesses where clientele and reputation are key, like those of tax preparers, interior  decorators, or hair stylists.



exAMpLe: Abe, Emily, and Tanya start an interior design business. But when Abe tries to do every color scheme in deep purple, the



two women say “enough” and decide to go their separate ways. Because each  of the three decorator/owners has his or her own client list, the only  property that needs to be divided consists of furniture and office  equipment and, of course, liabilities (debts).



Here are some common valuation alternatives used by privately owned small businesses:

- book value
- multiple of book value
- capitalization of earnings method, and
- appraisal value.

Let’s take a look at each one in turn.



Book Value (Valuation Method 2)

At least at the start, the value of a company’s assets minus its  liabilities is all many businesses are worth. Recognizing this, the  first valuation formula we present uses a company’s assets minus  liabilities as shown on the most recent year-end balance sheet.

Commonly, this number is called a company’s “book value,” but it also goes under  the names “net asset value” and “depreciated asset value.” (Assets are  listed on a company’s balance sheet at their “depreciated” value—the  cost of the asset minus depreciation taken on the asset.) Note that a  balance sheet usually lists the net amount of assets minus liabilities  as the “owners’ equity” amount. Theoretically, this figure can be  positive (if assets exceed liabilities) or negative (if liabilities  exceed assets).

As you no doubt know, a balance sheet is basically a snapshot of a  company’s assets minus liabilities on a particular date. Assets listed  on the balance sheet usually will include cash in the bank, real estate, business equipment and machinery, accounts receivable (money customers  owe to the business), and other types of tangible assets. Liabilities  usually consist of accounts payable (amounts owed to employees and  suppliers) plus the remaining balances on any loans taken out by the  company.



Advantages. A big advantage to choosing the book value method is that it uses figures that are readily available from the company’s financial statements.  Balance sheets are typically prepared as of

the end of each fiscal (tax) year of a company, and are needed to prepare  annual tax returns for the business. Because it is so easy to understand and implement, microbusinesses and start-ups often use the book value  method.



exAMpLe: The balance sheet of Mega-Mania Computer Supplies, Inc. shows assets  totaling $320,000 (after depreciation) and liabilities of $200,000.  Thus, shareholders’ (owners’) equity is

$120,000. It follows that if the company has issued 1,000 shares, and Joe owns  100 of them (Joe owns 10% of the company), the book value of his shares  is one-tenth of total owners’ equity,

or $12,000.



disadvantages. A big drawback to the “snapshot” aspect of the book value method,  however, is that it does not give you information on the profitability  of the business. Book value usually doesn’t measure the value of certain intangible assets, such as a strong reputation or customer goodwill,  which reflect the ability of the company to continue to earn a good  profit—these assets are not reflected on the company’s balance sheet. As a result, of all the valuation formulas, the book value method usually  results in the most conservative (lowest) valuation figure for a  business. (Also, book value can result in a low figure because the  depreciated value of assets—their original cost minus any  depreciation—may be less than the resale value of the assets.)

For these reasons, book value is most often used by owners of new  businesses that have yet to earn a profit or build up goodwill.

It is also the best method to use when owners wish to put the company’s  ongoing survival interests ahead of any individual owner’s interest in  selling out for top value. Again, this can make excellent sense if a  business is just getting off the ground and the owners are worried that  the company (or its remaining owners) will be hard



pressed to come up with money necessary to buy back a departing owner’s interest under the buyout agreement.



exAMpLe: Louise, Danny, and Ari form their own company, Digi-Fix, which provides  computer repair services. Each owns one-third of the company. After four years, Danny quits, deciding to turn his whitewater rafting hobby into a career

as a full-time river guide. On its last fiscal year balance sheet, the  company’s assets included cash in the bank, depreciated fixed assets  (mostly computers, tools, and equipment), and accounts receivable,  totaling $95,000. Liabilities consisted of accounts payable plus the  current remaining balance on a small business bank loan taken out by the company two years after its formation, totaling $60,000. The book value of the company—its owners’ equity—is the difference between assets and  liabilities, or $35,000. Using the book value method, each owner’s third of the company is worth $11,666 ($35,000 ÷ 3). The company’s cash  reserves, though modest, are adequate to pay Danny $11,666

for his interest, so the company purchases Danny’s interest and continues business operations with the two remaining owners.



The book value method, however, often does not make sense for long-term  owners. People who work in a business for many years expect to be fairly compensated at retirement or death. Using book value to come up with a  buyback price usually won’t provide an adequate buyout price for a  profitable, mature company. When your company reaches this point, it may be better to choose one of the other valuation methods below that  provide a higher buyout price.



exAMpLe: Let’s return to our Digi-Fix example, but assume now that it has been in  operation ten more years. Thanks to several very profitable long-term  service contracts, the three owners have been able to pay themselves  salaries of $80,000 per year for the past few years while hiring repair  people to do much of the work, allowing each owner to put in a three-day work week.



This time, it’s Louise who wants to leave, to spend more time with her two  young children. The book value of Digi- Fix’s assets on its last fiscal  year balance sheet was $125,000, consisting of $60,000 in equipment,  tools, and office furniture

(after depreciation), $35,000 in repair fees owed to the company by customers  (accounts receivable), and $30,000 cash. Liabilities totaled $50,000,  consisting of $40,000 owed to the local bank, plus various accounts  payable totaling $10,000. This means the total owners’ equity is $75,000 ($125,000 – $50,000). According to the book value method, Louise’s  interest is worth $25,000—one- third of the total book value of $75,000. This is a pretty low buyout amount for someone who has been receiving  $80,000 every year for three days of work! True, when Louise leaves,

she will no longer have to work those three days per week, and the  remaining owners may have to replace her. But surely they can do this  for less than $80,000 per year. At any rate, using the book value method would be a poor choice in this situation.

If the book value method will result in too low a buyout figure—as it will for most successful businesses in the long term—consider adopting or  switching to one of the other methods set out below.

The value of the company shall be its book value (its assets minus its  liabilities as shown on the balance sheet of the company) as

If You Own Real Estate

If your business owns considerable real estate (but does not use it mainly for rental income purposes), you may sensibly decide that valuing your  company based on its assets (real estate) is more appropriate for your  company than valuing it based on its earnings (rental income, for  example). Just the same, you may not want to use a straight book value  method to value the assets, because this method may not adequately  represent the value of your property. Book value can be inappropriate  for companies with real estate in particular, because real estate is  usually worth more than its depreciated value as shown on the company  balance sheet (in most geographical areas, anyway).

To come up with a formula that does a better job of valuing your real  property, you may want to provide that real property be valued at its  current market value.



exAMpLe: Let’s revisit Digi-Fix. This time assume that, many years ago, the computer  repair company bought the real estate where it does business. Since real estate has skyrocketed in their area, companies who bought real estate  there years ago can be worth quite a bit. The book value method would  surely not give any of the owners a fair buyout price, since that method doesn’t reflect the current market value of real estate.

If your company owns real estate, select the appraisal method in your  buyout agreement to value your company (discussed in Section 4, below). A professional will appraise your real estate at its fair market value at the time of a buyout.

Businesses Where the Book Value Method May Work

Valuing an owner’s interest at book value is most appropriate for companies  whose assets, rather than earnings potential, are the base, or strong  point, of the business. As mentioned in the text, this applies to  companies with low earnings and to companies just starting out, who  probably don’t have an established earnings record. Let’s look at a  couple of examples of which types of businesses this simple book value  approach often works best for.

- Start-up companies. When a business is young and has not yet developed a reputation or turned a  profit, the true value of the company may well be the amount of the  depreciated value of assets less its liabilities. And because the book  value method is based on the business’s financial statement, it will not lead to any extra costs for accounting, legal, or appraisal fees.

- Marginally profitable companies. Especially in a highly competitive field, many companies just aren’t able to make  much of a profit above their ongoing expenses, such as salaries, rent,  utilities, and advertising, meaning that an earnings-based valuation  method would produce a low value. Nevertheless, the company may have a  bright future if it can find a way to break away from the pack. In the  meantime, the book value method may do a fairly accurate job of valuing  the business.

  TIP

  use several years if your balance sheet numbers fluctuate

  

  from year to year. If your company has been in business several years but its balance sheet  numbers tend to fluctuate widely year to year (for instance, because of  large losses at the end of a year or the beginning of the next year),  you may want to provide that the book value of your company be derived  from several years’ balance sheets, not just the balance sheet of the  last fiscal year.

  

  Multiple of Book Value (Valuation Method 3)

  As we mentioned above, if a small business has been up and running  successfully for several years, its real value is probably greater than  its book value (the balance sheet value of its assets minus the balance  sheet value of its liabilities). For an outside buyer, there can be  considerable value in the fact that the owners of an ongoing business  have already set up a profitable business (for instance, bought or  leased equipment, installed a phone system, rented or bought a building, purchased inventory, developed a clientele, implemented a marketing  program, trained employees, and established an accounting system).

  Of course, most of the time, an outside buyer won’t be involved in your  buyout situation—the selling will be between the owners, between an  owner and the company, or between the company and an owner’s family.  Nevertheless, knowing what an outsider would pay for a company can give  you a good indication of its fair market value. That’s why it can be  sensible to use a valuation formula that treats your entire company as a candidate for sale—a formula that is likely to arrive at a dollar  figure that better reflects what an outside buyer would pay for a  profitable business.

  Enter the “multiple of book value” method. While based on book value, this  formula goes beyond measuring the book value of your company’s tangible  assets to take into account “intangible assets”

  and your company’s value as a “going concern.” These intangibles typically  include things whose worth is hard to calculate, such as a desirable  lease and the goodwill, or positive reputation, of the business. Other  intangible assets that can add value to a company are its brand or trade names, its mailing lists, and the anticipated effect of long-term  advertising campaigns.

  The multiple of book value method calculates the worth of the company by  taking the owners’ equity figure from your balance sheet and multiplying it by a predetermined number, called a multiplier. This  multiplier—which you and your co-owners will establish in your buy-sell  agreement—should be greater than 1 (or greater than 100%, if you use a  percentage). That’s because the

  

  purpose of the multiplier is to increase the Agreement Price of your company  beyond its book value to bring it closer to fair market value. Because  it is so difficult to precisely value goodwill and other intangibles,  picking the correct multiplier is at best an imprecise science.

  

  exAMpLe: Fit-Tite Jeans, Inc., a discount retailer of distressed, stretched-to-fit denim  jeans, with a desirable location near a big university, has had ten  years’ worth of steadily increasing

  business. Most years, both sales volume and profits have jumped by 10% or more.  Because customer satisfaction appears to be high, the owners of Fit-Tite expect business to remain good.

  An outside buyer would probably agree (though maybe not out loud) that  customer goodwill should be taken into account when offering a fair  price for the business.

  Wanting to account for their company’s goodwill, the Fit-Tite owners agree to  change the book value formula they adopted as part of their original  buy-sell agreement. They reason that

  it is only fair that any departing owner be bought out at an amount that  reflects the hard work she’s put in over the years and that better  represents what an outside buyer would pay for the business. To  accomplish this, the owners adopt a new agreement, selecting the  multiple of book value method and

  inserting a multiplier of 2 (200%) to double the book value figure taken from the company’s last balance sheet.

  

  The language for the multiple of book value method used in our buyout agreement is shown below.

  The Value of Goodwill

  Some profitable ongoing businesses are worth significantly more than the  balance sheet value of assets minus liabilities, because they’ve earned a good business reputation. That reputation brings in a steady stream of  regular business. This intangible asset, which business brokers call  “the well-founded expectation of continued public patronage,” or “going  concern value,” is more colloquially labeled goodwill. Taking goodwill  into account when setting a buyout price rewards the owners for putting  their skill and hard work into building up the company.

  The concept of business goodwill is especially applicable for successful  retail businesses—for example, a restaurant with a big following—but

  it is often less of a factor for businesses that depend primarily on  personalized service. For instance, a carpenter, podiatrist, or dentist  may have worked hard to acquire personal goodwill, but it’s tricky—and

  sometimes impossible—to transfer this goodwill to another person when the  business is sold. Or, put another way, when a person who provides  individual service retires or dies, much of the value of the business  disappears. And, of course, this is especially likely to be true if the  owner leaves to open or join a competing business.

  Although undoubtedly a real asset, the value of business goodwill is easily  overestimated following a change in business ownership. Even loyal  customers soon go elsewhere if the quality of a service or product  diminishes. For example, the reputation of even the most established  restaurant can quickly take a dive if new management takes over

  and the menu and service don’t match previously met expectations. And as a  rule, the more competition there is in a particular market, the less  goodwill is worth—after all, in this age of the pampered consumer,  people will quickly go elsewhere if offered even a slightly better  service or price.

  TIP

  use additional years if your balance sheet fluctuates. As with

  

  the regular book value method, if your company has been in business several years but assets and liabilities tend to fluctuate fairly widely from  one year to the next (for instance, because large expenses accrue at the end of a year or the beginning of the next year), you may want to  provide that the book value figures from balance sheets of several years should be used to arrive at an average adjusted book value amount.

  

  Capitalization of Earnings (Valuation Method 4)

  

  ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_138.png)

  FAST TRACk

  For established companies only. This method measures

  

  a business’s value by its average annual profits. If your company is just starting out, it’s premature to value your ownership interests by using the

  capitalization of earnings method, since your business has no earnings history. Better to adopt another valuation provision for your first couple of years,  then switch over to this valuation method later. While we recommend  reading this section to get an idea of what may be in your future, if  you’re pressed for time, you may want to skip ahead to the appraisal  method below.

  

  Once a company produces a good profit for several years in a row and appears to have a promising future, it often makes sense to base its value on  its average annual earnings. Earnings often better reflect a small, but  established, company’s value than its assets and liabilities do. A solid earnings history is often a pretty good predictor of how the company  will perform in the future.

  

  exAMpLe: Two restaurants are each worth $175,000 according to the book value method  (balance sheet assets minus liabilities). But their values diverge if  you look at each restaurant’s profit picture. After paying each of its  three owners a salary of $50,000 per year, Peas and Carrots, Inc., has  earned an annual profit averaging $10,000 over the last three years. But Mucho Mocha, Corp., which also has three owners and pays the same  salaries, produces yearly profits averaging $80,000 per year. Clearly,  pushing caffeine beats flogging legumes. Based on the likelihood that  (in the immediate future, at least) both businesses’ profits will stay  near their three-year average, Mucho Mocha is probably worth more than  Peas and Carrots. Thus, a book value valuation method, which results in a similar value for both companies, won’t produce accurate results for  Mucho Mocha, but the capitalization of earnings method, which takes into account Mucho Mocha’s higher earning capacity, will produce a much  fairer result.

  

  Under the capitalization of earnings method, you first determine the  company’s annual earnings, or profit, by subtracting the cost of doing  business from gross revenues. Next you multiply the earnings by a  number—usually between two and ten—called a multiplier.

  The selection of a multiplier should depend, at least to some degree, on  your company’s industry as well as on general conditions. That’s because once some types of businesses become solidly profitable, they are  likely to stay that way, while other types of endeavors are much more  likely to produce up-and-down profits. For example,

  a small educational publishing company with an established and defensible market niche may be valued at about ten times average

  

  annual profits. However, a small publisher of fiction—a much chancier  venture—is likely to be valued at a much lower multiple of annual  profits, perhaps two. (Choosing a multiplier is discussed further  below.)

  You apply your selected multiplier to the average annual earnings from  several consecutive years—called the “base earnings period.”

  

  exAMpLe: The four owners of Bean Bag Furniture, Inc. guessed right: They obtained a long-term, low-rent lease on a store in

  a rundown area that is rapidly becoming one of the trendiest shopping  districts in town. After an initial period of marginal returns, their  business is just plain booming. For the past three years, net profits,  after paying each working owner a decent salary, have averaged $250,000. Now one owner has decided to retire. The owners’ buy-sell agreement  calls for arriving at the value of the business by multiplying its  average net profits for the past three years by a multiplier of two.  Thus, Bean Bag’s value

  is $250,000 x 2, or $500,000. It follows that, since the retiring owner  holds one-fourth of the total shares, her interest is worth

  keep in mind that with a few adjustments, a balance sheet can make a  business appear more or less profitable than it really is. For example,  the owners’ salaries or draws could be way more or way less than the

  industry averages. Or a business can temporarily show chunky profits by postponing major expenses.

  If you think your balance sheet may need adjusting before it fairly states your profit, you may want to have a professional appraiser or  independent business valuation expert make appropriate adjustments so  that the numbers reflect the earning value of your company more  realistically and accurately.

  

  Earnings Figure May Not Accurately Represent True Profit

  

  $125,000 under the capitalization of earnings method.

  

  

  

  It’s almost always a mistake to choose a base earnings period shorter than  three years (and the IRS prefers to see figures that represent a  five-year average), because doing so would risk an ex- ceptionally good  or bad year’s skewing the results.

  The capitalization of earnings method requires you to do a fair bit of  research, or educated guessing, before you agree on the multiplier to  insert in your buyout agreement. Many factors should go into choosing a  multiplier, or capitalization rate, including:

  - General economic conditions. For example, if yours is a tourist-based business and the economy is  heading toward a recession, your multiplier should be lower than if the  economy is growing fast and consumers have plenty of disposable income.

  - The nature of your business. This includes the type of products and services you sell and whether customers are loyal to

    you or another co-owner. For example, if the service your business sells is highly personal, such as is often true for interior decorators, the  company may not do well if a key co-owner leaves, meaning you’ll  probably want to choose a low multiplier.

  - The age of your business. The longer your business has been profitable (especially if profits are  stable or growing), the higher the multiplier you’ll normally want to  choose.

  - The risk—or lack thereof—inherent in operating your business. For example, if your business is under assault by new competitors and  profits are falling, it’s probably worth a lot less than if the reverse  is true, and you’ll want to choose a low multiplier.

  - Multipliers used in similar sales. Try to find out what multi- pliers have been used in recent sales of  interests in similar small businesses. But make sure the comparable  sales figures you look at are both current and truly comparable.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_139.png)

TIP

capitalization rate is the same as a multiplier. In reading or



talking with an expert about the capitalization of earnings method, you may  come across the jargon “capitalization rate,” or “cap rate.” Don’t be  daunted— the term capitalization rate means exactly the same thing as a  multiplier— thus, using a cap rate of ten simply means multiplying your  earnings by ten.



Be realistic when you choose a multiplier. One experienced small business  adviser we know recommends against using a multiplier higher than three. Anything more could cripple the business with too high a buyout price.  However, some experts say that, for a larger business with a superb  earnings history, a highly desirable market niche, and a solidly  positive cash flow, it can sometimes make sense to pay as much as ten  times earnings, which would make the selling owner quite happy.

Because there are so many factors that can affect the choice of a multiplier,  using this method is often most sensible in an industry where the  multiplier has been generally defined and accepted in the trade.  Construction companies, retail stores, and restaurants are examples of  businesses where it can be reasonably easy to obtain information on  standard industry multipliers.

people who regularly buy and sell businesses are a good



source of information. Business appraisers and brokers, especially those who specialize in a particular industry, often can tell you what sorts of multipliers are in general  use in your type of business. Trade publications that report prices paid for businesses that change hands are another good source of  information.

Fine-tuning your formula. You can customize your earnings formula to be as complicated or as  uncomplicated as you wish, but whichever method you choose, your price  or formula should be reasonable, fair, and affordable. Depending on your company’s circumstances, you may wish to provide for the earnings  formula to do any of the following:

- Weigh your earnings average to reﬂect a recent upward earnings trend (counting the most recent year’s earnings the most).



- Provide for a partial allocation of annual earnings in case an owner leaves in the middle of a fiscal year.
- Define earnings as operating earnings before the subtraction of interest,  taxes, depreciation, and amortization (this EBITDA formula is commonly  used in some industry sectors as the measure of earnings that is  multiplied by the earnings multiplier to establish a value of a  business). This option eliminates the effects of a business’s financing  and accounting decisions.

These adjustments must be made by someone who knows the particulars of your  business. If you’re interested in including them in your buyout  agreement, we recommend you get an expert’s help.

Rates of Return and Earnings Multipliers

To really understand how the capitalization of earnings method works, it  helps to understand what the term “expected rate of return” means. This  is the percentage of an investment that a buyer expects to get back each year. For instance, if you put $100,000 in a certificate of deposit  (CD) with an interest rate of 5%, your rate of return on that investment would be 5%, meaning you’d make about $5,000 in interest each year.

In terms of buying a small business, to get a 5% rate of return on a  purchase price of $100,000, the company would have to earn profits of  $5,000 per year. If you, as an investor, had the option of putting your

$100,000 into a guaranteed CD or into a small business to get the same annual  profits of $5,000 per year, you’d probably take the CD. Why

put your money in an inherently risky small business when you are  guaranteed the same return from an insured bank? For that reason, a 5%  rate of return on a business investment might be an unacceptably low  rate if interest rates for safe investments are at 5%. An expected rate  of 10% to 15% would be more reasonable, depending on economic  conditions.

In valuing a business based on its earnings, the multiplier, or  capitaliza- tion rate, varies inversely with the expected rate of  return. For example, if a company uses a multiplier of 20 (20 times  annual earnings), a buyer



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_145.png)

Rates of Return and Earnings Multipliers (continued)

would only get a rate of return of 5% (100% ÷ 20). If the company uses the  much lower multiplier of 5, a buyer would expect a more desirable 20%  rate of return (100% ÷ 5). (Would-be buyers—the company and continuing  owners—like low multipliers.)



| Rate of Return | Multiplier/Cap Rate |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 5%             | 20                  |
| 8%             | 12.5                |
| 10%            | 10                  |
| 15%            | 6.67                |
| 20%            | 5                   |
| 25%            | 4                   |
| 30%            | 3.33                |
| 50%            | 2                   |



The rate of return paid by other investments will affect the multiplier you choose. That’s because, as mentioned above, the rate of return a buyer  will want to achieve when investing in a risky small business will be  substantially above what he could get if he placed his money in a CD, a

U.S. government bond, or other comparably safe investment.

The expected rate of return is also likely to be somewhat above the return a buyer would anticipate receiving by investing in the stock market. For  example, if the stock market has averaged an 11% rate of return over the last few years (an optimistic figure these days), an 8% rate of return  from a small business (and thus a multiplier of 12.5) won’t look nearly  as good as it would if the stock market’s recent average rate of return  was 5%. In this case, an investor in a small business would probably be  looking for at least a 20% rate of return (and thus a multiplier of no  higher than 5)—for quick payback on his investment. On the other hand,  if the stock market has been averaging 5% returns, or even negative  returns, a 10% rate of return would look pretty good.



Appraisal Value (Valuation Method 5)

By now, it may seem that you have to be a financial wizard to come up with a fair buyout price or an appropriate valuation formula for a small  business. Don’t worry—there is an easy, if more expensive, way out: You  can adopt a provision that simply provides for your business’s value to  be established by a professional business appraisal at the time of a  buyout.

The appraisal method involves agreeing to hire one or more professional  appraisers who will decide the value of your business for you at the  time of a buyout. Here is the way our appraisal method works: As part of the buyout process, the buyer (usually the company or the continuing  owners) and the seller (the departing owner, the representative of a  deceased owner’s estate, or the ex- spouse of a divorced owner) each  choose an independent appraiser to value the company. If the appraisers  come up with a similar price, often the parties can negotiate a mutually agreeable price. But if

the appraisers arrive at very different values and cannot agree on a price, our buyout agreement requires the two appraisers to choose a third  appraiser to make yet another appraisal, which is used as the Agreement  Price. The appraised value is binding on all parties.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_146.png)

TIP

choose a knowledgeable appraiser. One way to reduce the



possibility of disputes and to hold down expenses is to agree on one appraiser that all owners have confidence in. Find an independent appraiser who  intimately knows your industry and, preferably, your segment of it.



Although using an appraisal approach to value your company may seem like a safe, conventional approach, there are a few potential drawbacks. Here are  several:

- cost. Having an appraiser can reduce guesswork and, hopefully, conflict, but it can  also be expensive and time- consuming. Business valuations usually cost a minimum

  

  of $1,000 and up to $2,500 for $100,000 companies, up to

  $5,000 for $500,000 businesses, and $10,000 and above for larger companies.  Using two or three appraisers will double or triple these amounts. In  short, for a small business, appraisal costs can eat up a chunk of cash.

  - Lack of predictability. Unlike most other valuation methods, establishing your business’s value based  on a time-of-sale appraisal does not provide a valuation figure you can  look to in advance of a buyout. This can mean an owner who is  contemplating leaving the company or adopting an estate plan won’t have  essential information she needs. This also means the company or  co-owners will not know how much life or disability insurance to take  out or how much liquidity will be needed to fund a potential buyout.  (See “Ongoing Appraisal Packages,” below, for a way around these  problems).
  - disputes. It may be difficult, even for an independent professional appraiser, to  subjectively but fairly value a small private company whose shares are  not traded on any exchange, especially if one of the principals has died or is leaving the business. While naming an appraiser in your buyout  agreement takes a big step toward avoiding conflict, if tension between  owners is already present, the appraisal process can still be rancorous  and political. You always take the risk that one party or another will  contest the appraisal based on a claim that the appraiser unfairly  favored the other side.
  - delays. It can take some time to get an appraiser’s report, unless you have the  good fortune of finding an appraiser who is both experienced in your  line of business and prompt. To avoid delays, your agreement sets a  certain period for the selection of an appraiser (this also prevents one of the owners from using the appraiser selection process as a delay  tactic) and for the appraisal itself.

Appraiser Credentials

Anyone can value a business—generally, there is no license requirement. We  suggest, however, hiring an independent appraiser with professional *credentials*, who has been tested for proficiency and understanding

of the fundamentals of appraisal concepts and ethics. As in many other  fields, the business valuation industry has created its own

professional designations. While many appraisers are also certified public  accountants, the American Society of Appraisers (a widely respected  private accreditation group) uses these designations:

- AM (Accredited Member): requires two years of full-time appraisal experience

- ASA (Accredited Senior Appraiser): requires five years of full-time appraisal experience

- FASA (Fellow Appraiser): an Accredited Senior Appraiser who has been  recognized by ASA’s International Board of governors for outstanding  services to the appraisal profession and/or the Society of Appraisers.

  [Another  group, which accredits appraisers of closely held businesses according  to education and experience qualifications, is the Institute of Business  Appraisers—see their website at www.go-iba.org.](http://www.go-iba.org/)

  

  The appraisal valuation language in our agreement, shown below, provides  for the mutual selection of one appraiser, or, if that doesn’t work out, it provides a mechanism for choosing two or three appraisers.

  Ongoing Appraisal Packages

  

  Some business appraisal firms offer an ongoing “buy-sell agreement service.” For a set price, they will perform annual valuation “checkups” on your  company, giving you and your co-owners a dependable annual valuation  that will normally withstand IRS scrutiny. It’s helpful for insurance,  estate planning, and business planning reasons to have handy a  reasonably recent estimation of your company’s value. As an added bonus, before any buybacks actually occur, you’ll get to know and trust your  appraiser, and the appraiser will get to know the strengths and  weaknesses of your business.

  

  

  n Valuation Method 5: Appraised Value

  The value of the company shall be its fair market value as determined by an independent appraiser mutually selected by Buyer(s) and Seller of the  ownership interest subject to purchase under this agreement. If Buyer(s) and Seller are unable to agree upon an independent appraiser within 30  days, Buyer(s) and Seller, within the next 10 days, shall each select an independent appraiser. If the two selected appraisers are unable,  within 60 days, to agree on the fair market value of the company, then  the two appraisers shall select a third independent appraiser within the next 10 days, who shall, within 30 days, determine the fair market  value of the company. All costs of an appraiser mutually selected by  Buyer(s) and Seller or of a third appraiser selected by two appraisers  shall be shared equally by Buyer(s) and Seller. All costs of an  individually selected appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting the appraiser. The value of an individual owner’s interest shall be the  entire value for the company as determined under this paragraph,  multiplied by his or her ownership percentage.

  There are many other ways to value your business. Although

  

  we include the most common types of valuation methods in our buyout  agreement, there are many other different versions of each. And we  obviously don’t have the facts necessary to tailor our agreement to  exactly match the needs of your business. Whether yours is a  manufacturing, wholesale, retail, or service business, it’s important to recognize that a more custom-tailored valuation method may lead to a  more accurate estimation of the worth

  he payment terms in your buyout agreement control how and when a buyer  must make payments to the seller under any buyout that arises under the  buyout agreement. (For our

  purposes, the buyer will probably be the company or the continuing owners, or  possibly an owner’s child or a key employee. The seller will probably be a selling owner, his family members, or his estate representative.)

  Lest you think that payment terms are just annoying financial details that  can be handled quickly at the time of a buyout, consider that payment  terms often can make or break a deal. Reasonable payment terms can make  an otherwise unaffordable buyout afford- able for the company or  continuing owners.

  Payment terms can also affect the most important aspect of a buyout—the price  that the buyer is willing to pay and the seller is willing to accept.  For instance, terms that are more favorable to the buyer, such as a  low-interest installment plan that extends over five years, can allow  the seller to receive a higher final price. In contrast, payment terms  that favor the seller, such as an immediate, one- time, lump-sum cash  payment, might lower the price the buyer is able to pay.

  TIP

  Insurance payoffs can come in a series of payments. It’s possible

  

  to coordinate a payment plan with life insurance or disability insurance  funding (see Chapter 5). Your agreement can provide for a series of  payments that are tied to insurance payouts. If you choose to do this,  make sure your payment plan meshes with the insurance policy’s payout  schedule.

  

  Balancing the Interests of Buyer and Seller

  Because payment terms can have a great effect on the success of any buyout that arises under your buyout agreement, you want to pick a payment plan  that is perceived as fair to both buyer and seller. The seller, of  course, usually will want to receive payment for his interest

  

  fairly quickly, while the buyer will probably want to make payments over as long a time as possible.

  However, both sides have an interest in establishing terms that make it possible for your company or the continuing owners to exercise a buyout. If  payment terms are too severe, the buying

  company or co-owners may not be able to afford them. For example, payment terms that require a 100% lump-sum cash payout right away can prevent even  the most successful companies from buying back an owner’s interest. Or,  if the company does make the purchase, such harsh payment terms may harm or even destroy the business.

  Either way, the buyout can end up failing.

  But in case you are tempted to provide extremely lenient buyout terms to  benefit the buyer (for example, low payments over many years), remember  to balance your concern for the continued well- being of the company  with the need to minimize inconvenience to a departing owner—or her  family, if the owner has died. (After all, this could be you or your  family.)

  Depending on the circumstances, a departing owner or her family normally has a  legitimate interest in getting the buyback money reasonably fast. Aside  from the obvious reasons of needing money for expenses, waiting a period of years to be paid off carries big risks. For example, if the  remaining owners make bad business choices, they could render the  business insolvent, with the result that the departing owner or her  family may never receive all—or a substantial portion of—the buyout  price. And, of course, how and when the payments occur can be of intense concern if the departing owner is pulling out precisely because she  doesn’t trust the others.

  A good balance may be to require the buyer to pay a good chunk of the  purchase price up front and require the seller to carry back only 20% to 30% of the purchase price to be paid over three to five years. (And if  the seller never sees the rest of the money, at least he’s received the  lion’s share of it.)

  Your choice of payment terms may depend on where the funds to purchase an owner’s interest will come from. If you opt to fund a

  

  buyout with life and/or disability insurance (discussed in Chapter 5), some buyout scenarios may be funded immediately.

  Of course, you can’t know ahead of time what payment terms will work for  both parties in a particular buyout situation. But choosing a fair  payment plan now will at least give you a starting point to negotiate  from when an actual buyout looms.

  

  ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_153.png)

  TIP

  payment terms are not written in stone. Any payment term

  

  you adopt now can be changed if all owners agree. For instance, suppose you choose a five-year payment plan now, with interest at 10% per year on  the unpaid balance. Now, suppose seven years after you sign your  agreement, when your business is prosperous, a departing owner says,  “You know, I’d

  like to get as much cash as I can now to invest in a new business. I propose that you pay me, right now, 50% of what I would have received over a  five- year payment plan.” If this seems fair to the remaining owners,  all can agree to substitute the lump-sum payment for the five-year  payment plan. You will want to get the unanimous written consent of all  owners to any change of payment terms and place a copy of the signed  consent in your company records book.

  

  Following are several common ways to set up payment terms.

  

  Lump-Sum Cash Payment

  This method requires the buyer to pay the full amount of the buyback price  in cash within a specified number of days from the date the buyer  provides a Notice of Intent to Purchase to the seller.

  Again, we believe requiring a lump-sum payment can be problematic, since the  company or the continuing owners are unlikely to have sufficient cash on hand and, unless the business is extremely solvent, may be unable to  obtain a loan from a bank to fund the cash buyout of the ownership  interest. The unhappy

  

  result may be that the company or the continuing owners are unable to exercise their buyout rights to avoid having a new owner come on board. This  means an owner’s inheritor or ex-spouse—or an outsider—may be allowed to hold on to his ownership interests, just the result the buyout  agreement is designed to avoid.

  Section VII: payment terms

  unless otherwise provided in this agreement, the undersigned agree that the  payment terms checked below shall be used for the purchase of ownership  interests under this agreement.

  n payment terms Alternative 1: Full cash payment

  Cash payment for the Seller’s ownership interest shall be made by Buyer(s) to Seller within [insert number of days, typically "30" or "60"] days of the date the company provides a Notice of Intent to Purchase to the Seller under this agreement.

  

  The lump-sum payment provision in our buy-sell agreement is shown below.

  turn to your worksheet. If you wish to choose the full cash payment alternative, check this  provision on your worksheet. (Section VII, Payment Terms Alternative 1.) Insert in the blank the numbers of days (from the date of the company’s Notice of Intent to Purchase) by which payment must be made.

  

  Installment Plans

  Typically, buyout agreements require a departing owner (or his estate or family  members) to receive at least part of the purchase price in installment  payments (to “carry back” part of the price) over

  

  several years. This method has a hidden advantage for the company and the  continuing owners: It ensures the departing owner will take a continued  interest in the financial health of the company until the debt is paid  off.

  If the installment period is more than two years, you might consider using a floating interest rate, perhaps prime rate or one point above prime.  That way, your interest rate won’t become outdated if rates increase or  decrease in the years before a buyout occurs. The most commonly used  index for the prime rate is *The Wall Street Journal*. If you wish  to do this, rather than inserting an interest rate like “5%” in your  agreement, you can insert something like “Wall Street Journal Prime, as published in *The Wall Street Journal* Money Rate section, adjusted monthly, plus 1%.”

  

  Equal Payments Under an Installment Plan

  Using this approach, the company or the buying owners pay the purchase price, plus interest, in installments. This type of payment plan is not used  often—most sellers want a good-sized portion of the purchase price up  front. (See the next section for a payment plan that requires a down  payment followed by installment pay- ments.) However, in a family  business situation where an owner is transferring ownership to her  children, or perhaps a key employee, the owner may be willing to take  regular payments without a big down payment up front. Another possible  scenario where this installment plan could be used is when installment  payments will be made with staggered insurance policy payouts (some  buy-sell insurance policies pay out benefits in installments).

  You can adopt any installment payment schedule that you and your co-owners  conclude is most likely to meet your needs—perhaps providing for equal  payments over two or three years. Of course, without a large down  payment, the seller has an interest in receiving payments for his  interest fairly quickly, perhaps over no more than one to three years.

TIP

You can customize your payments terms. It’s possible to change



this provision to provide for payments to increase or decrease over a number of years, perhaps tied to future levels of profits.



Down Payment Plus Installment Payments

This method specifies an initial cash down payment on the buyout date  followed by periodic payments on a portion of the purchase price, plus  interest, until the full amount is paid. A down payment of one-third to  two-thirds of the buyout price is often required, followed by  installment payments for three to five years. Of course, with a higher  down payment, a longer installment period may be acceptable.

TIP

Insurance proceeds can fund the down payment used to buy a deceased or disabled owner’s interest. You can use any life or disability insurance proceeds taken out on an owner to make the down payment on a disabled or deceased owner’s interest  (for a discussion of insurance funding, see Chapter 5). We don’t  specifically tie the down payment to the amount of insurance proceeds in our provision below, since this really isn’t necessary—if insurance  proceeds are available, you simply use them at the time of the buyout to fund the down payment.

  The purchase of an ownership interest shall be accomplished as follows: An initial cash payment of [*insert the cash amount* *of the purchase price to be paid up front, such as "$40,000"*] shall be paid by Buyer(s) to Seller within [*insert number of days* *for down payment, such as "30"*] days of the date the company

  provides a Notice of Intent to Purchase to Seller. The remainder of the purchase price shall be paid by Buyer(s) to Seller in equal installments over a  term of [*insert term for repayment in months,* *such as "24"*] months, with interest added to the amount of

  each installment computed at an annual rate of [*insert interest* *rate*]% and compounded annually on the unpaid continuing balance of the  purchase price of the ownership interest. The first installment payment  shall be made by Buyer(s) on [*insert date of first installment payment*], and the continuing payments shall be made by Buyer(s) on the [*insert payment due day, typically* *"1st"*] of every month, until the full balance of the purchase price, together with any interest owed, is paid in full.

  

  Interest-Only Installment Payments

  Using this payment method, payment of the purchase price is postponed until a future date. Until this future date, the company makes installment  payments of interest only. We rarely recommend this approach, except  possibly in the first year or two of a new business or in a family  business situation where affluent members of an older generation are  looking for a generous way to transfer ownership to their children  without making an outright gift.

  Monthly Installments of Interest only, With a Final payment for the Full purchase price

  Buyer(s) shall pay Seller the purchase price for an ownership interest on [*insert* *future date for full payment of purchase price*]. Until such date, Buyer(s) shall pay Seller monthly payments of interest, computed at an annual rate of [*insert* *interest rate*]%

  The provision in our buyout agreement that allows interest-only installment payments is shown below.

  TIP

  At the time of a buyout, this method may be used as a

  

  temporary payment method. Occasionally, when a co-owner leaves, neither the company nor the co-owners can  afford to make the payments required by their buyout agreement. If so,  all may agree to substitute an interest-only agreement such as this one  on an interim basis.

  

  Customized Schedule of Payment

  With this method, set amounts are paid at chosen times (for example,  one-quarter of the purchase price, with interest, anytime during

  the following four calendar quarters). Obviously, the total of all payments should equal the full amount of the buyback price to be paid for the  ownership interest, plus any interest charged on the financed amount.  This might make sense for seasonal businesses, or for businesses that  make most of their annual income once a year.

Write down whatever terms you’re  thinking of, including dates for payment, any applicable interest rates  and the number of months over which payments will be made. You may need  to ask a lawyer to draft these terms for you. (Section VII, Payment  Terms Alternative 5.)

  

  

  Creative Ways to Pay

  You and your co-owners may come up with any number of other ways to  compensate a departing owner and ease the financial pain of future  buyouts.

  consulting fees. Regardless of how you plan now to pay out the purchase price, how an actual buyout is paid for years from now might look very different. For instance,  suppose you plan to fund a company buyout of a departing owner like  this: one-third cash

  reserves, one-third bank loan, and one-third installment plan. When an owner  gives notice that she wants to be bought out, but is willing to work for the company on an advisory basis, the company and

  the owner might agree that the owner will take half of the purchase price  up front (which the company pays for with cash reserves and a loan), and the other half in the form of consulting fees.

  

  ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_167.png)

  TIP

  paying consulting fees can lower the company’s tax cost. Like

  

  salaries, consulting fees can be tax-deducted by the company, but are treated as  ordinary income to the departing owner (rather than as capital gains).  (This is beneficial for the company as a whole but not so good for the  departing owner.) The income tax consequences of buyouts are discussed  further in Chapter 9.

  

  Lease payments or licensing fees. Another creative way a company can deduct payments to the departing owner is to pay the departing owner lease payments or licensing fees. If the  departing owner owns real estate or equipment that the business rents,  the owner can receive these lease payments. Or, if a departing owner  owns

  a copyright or patent, the company or continuing owners could pay the  departing owner licensing fees or royalty payments for the intellectual  property the owner leaves behind at the company.

  Increased retirement funding. The company could set up a retirement fund before the departing owner leaves and contribute

  

  large amounts to it to compensate the owner for past services (the continuing owners may be able to opt out of the retirement plan for a time, or  reduce their salaries or distributions, to pay for this). This gives the company a tax deduction on the payments, but the departing owner will  owe taxes when money is taken out of the retirement fund.

  deferred compensation. Similarly, the company could set up a deferred compensation plan and arrange to  pay the departing owner a “defined benefit.” (A defined benefit plan can pay the departing owner a fixed amount at his departure or retirement  from the company; for example, the departing owner might receive $20,000 per year for ten years.) The company would be able to deduct the  deferred compensation payments to the departing owner, but they would be taxed to the departing owner as ordinary income.

  private annuity. Another creative way to structure and fund a buyout is to use a private  annuity. The departing owner can opt to receive a “private annuity” in  exchange for giving the company her ownership interest. The company  would pay a fixed amount each year directly to the departing owner for  the remainder of her life. The payments to the departing owner would be  treated as capital gains. This comes with two tax advantages: The  ownership interest would not appreciate during the departing owner’s  lifetime, and the departing owner could spread her capital gain out over her lifetime. When the business is in excellent financial shape, this  approach can make sense. But in other circumstances, a private annuity  can be risky, since, if the business goes belly up, the departing owner  probably won’t get paid enough to cover the purchase price.

  CAUTION

  Funding a future buyout with a retirement plan, deferred compensation, or a private annuity is not for the do-it-yourselfer. If you’re interested in finding out more about funding a future buyout  with one of these methods, see a lawyer or pension specialist to set it  up for you.

  ### I

  

  n this chapter, we cover the last few steps you’ll need to take to  finalize your agreement. We’ll also explain the last few sections of our buyout agreement: resolving disputes, binding new

  owners to the agreement, and placing a legend on your ownership certificates.

  For the future, we’ll also let you know how to resolve conflicts that may  come up during an actual buyout and how to update your agreement when  your circumstances change.

  

  Finalizing Your Buyout Agreement

  Before you sign your agreement, you need to decide whether you’ll keep your  buyout provisions in a separate document or whether you’ll insert them  into an existing document, such as your

  corporate bylaws, your LLC operating agreement or your partnership agreement.  Because corporations, LLCs, and partnerships are such different animals, sometimes we have different advice for owners of these types of  businesses. This is one of those times.

  

  For Corporations

  If you do business as a corporation, you can add your buyout provisions to your bylaws or you can adopt your buyout provisions as a separate  agreement—often called a “shareholders’ agreement” in the corporate  context. This type of agreement is signed by all shareholders and is  just as valid and binding on the owners of a corporation as the  provisions of the corporate articles and bylaws.

  We believe the latter approach—adopting a distinct agreement—is best. By  keeping your agreement separate from your organizational documents and  having each owner sign it, you emphasize the import- ance of its buyout  provisions. With full disclosure thus assured, an owner can’t later  claim surprise when she wants to sell to an outsider and her co-owners  invoke the terms of the buyout agreement to stop the transaction.

  

  Creating a Separate Agreement

  To adopt a separate buyout agreement, have all shareholders date and sign  the agreement at the bottom, using the signature page included at the  end of the buyout agreement.

  

  ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_170.png)

  TIP

  refer to your buyout agreement in your bylaws. If you adopt

  

  your buyout provisions in a separate buyout agreement, as we suggest, we  recommend that you add a provision to your current bylaws that refers to the existence of your buyout agreement. (Legally, this tactic is called “incorporating your buyout agreement by reference” into your bylaws.)

  Doing this helps to cover all your legal bases and can help avoid a challenge to your buyout agreement from someone looking for a legal way out of  its enforceability.

  To do this, amend your bylaws by adding a sentence that recognizes that a  separate agreement exists to control and regulate the ownership of  interests in the corporation. Here is one simple way to phrase this new  bylaw provision.

  

  

  

  ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_171.gif)

  

  The provisions of the agreement among the shareholders dated [insert date of signing of your buy-sell agreement], which regulates the transfer of ownership interests in the corporation and other related matters,

  is hereby incorporated by reference into these Bylaws and shall be binding on the corporation, its creditors, its shareholders and their assigns  and successors, and other parties as provided in the agreement.

  

  Adding the Buyout Provisions to Your Bylaws

  If, instead, you decide to add your buyout provisions to your bylaws,  simply cut and paste the buyout provisions from our CD-ROM into your  existing bylaws (don’t include the signature page from our buyout  agreement).

  

  We recommend that you add the buyout provisions to the end of your bylaws, but you can insert them anywhere you wish. When adding these provisions to the document, you will want to change the paragraph numbering or  lettering of the buyout provisions to conform to the numbering or  lettering scheme of your existing bylaws.

  Remember to have all owners (and their spouses) sign the new bylaws.

  

  Reviewing Your Bylaws

  Whichever approach you take, you’ll need to make sure that your buyout provisions do not conflict with the existing provisions of your articles and  bylaws. Mostly, you want to check to make sure that an existing bylaw  does not prohibit, or impose additional rules on, any of the procedures  covered in your buyout provisions. For example,

  if your corporate bylaws completely prohibit the transfer of shares in  your corporation, but your buyout provisions allow an owner to sell to  an outside buyer under certain circumstances, you will want to amend  your bylaws to delete the prohibition against transfers.

  

  Approving Amendments to Your Bylaws

  If you’ve amended your articles or bylaws—whether you’ve added the buyout provisions directly or you’ve just incorporated them

  by reference—the shareholders need to approve that amendment. You should  meet any special voting requirements under state law and in your  articles or bylaws for shareholder approval of such an amendment.

  Shareholder approval to amend your articles or bylaws can be obtained in two ways: 1) at a formal shareholders meeting,

  documented by written minutes, or 2) by having each shareholder sign a written  consent form that says he or she approves the buyout provisions attached to the written consent. While not always required under state law or  corporate articles or bylaws, we also recommend that all directors of  the corporation separately approve the amendment to the bylaws. Just  hold a directors meeting or

  

  prepare a written consent for directors to sign as you did with your shareholders.

  Placing a Legend on Your Certificates

  Another task you’ll need to perform after adopting your buyout provisions is to update your stock certificates to give notice of the buyout  restrictions on the shares to potential creditors and buyers. Most  states require you to add language to each certificate stating that the  shares are subject to the terms of a shareholders’ agreement. This  statement is called a stock certificate “legend.”

  We believe the placement of a legend on certificates is essential to  remind owners and to give notice to others who may buy or receive  ownership interests, that interests cannot be disposed

  of at will, but only under the terms of a buyout or shareholders’  agreement. If you don’t do this, you invite confusion and controversy  from successors to ownership interests who claim ignorance of the  existence of your buyout restrictions.

  The language of Section IX of our buyout agreement requires the placement  of a legend on certificates, as shown below. The legend says that your  secretary or other equivalent officer of the company will provide a copy of the text of your agreement to any requesting person, whether an  owner or not. Make sure to honor any such requests.

  Here’s how to comply with this section of the agreement:

  - existing certificates. The secretary of the company should gather up all the outstanding  certificates issued to the company’s existing owners and type the legend in capital letters on the front of all certificates.



- new certificates. The secretary should also type this legend on any new certificates issued  to future owners. One way to ensure this happens is to type the legend  on all blank certificates that remain in your corporate or LLC records  binder. When these certificates are issued to new owners,

  ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_173.gif)

  

  Section Ix: placement of notice of transfer restrictions on certificates

  1. The following statement must appear conspicuously on each ownership certificate issued by the company:

     THE INTERESTS REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS  UPON TRANSFER AND ARE REDEEMABLE PURSUANT TO PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN AN  AgREEMENT AMONg THE OWNERS OF THE COMPANY. FOR A COPY OF THIS AgREEMENT, CONTACT THE SECRETARY OR EQUIVALENT OFFICER OF THE COMPANY AT THE  PRINCIPAL

     OFFICE OF THE COMPANY AT [*insert company's address*].

  2. The secretary or other equivalent officer of the company shall provide to  any owner or third person upon written request and without charge a copy of this agreement.

  

  the legend will already be on them, and you will not have to remember to perform this task.

  

  

  

  ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_174.png)

  TIP

  order new certificates if the legend won’t fit. If there is

  

  insufficient room on your current certificates to type the legend, or if you wish to have this legend printed on new certificates by a legal stationer,  order new certificates. (Some states allow the legend to go on the back  of certificates, but we don’t like this idea—an owner may not flip the  certificate over to read the language on the back.)

  

  If you do this, you can exchange the new certificates bearing the printed  legend with the old certificates held by your current owners. Make sure  to note the cancellation of the old certificates and the issuance of the new certificates in your company’s transfer ledger or records binder.

  

  For LLCs and Partnerships

  For general and limited partnerships, the partnership agreement, and for  LLCs, the LLC operating agreement, are the primary agreements among the  owners of the business. They set out the capital contributions of the  owners and their rights and responsibilities with respect to each other. For these types of businesses, you may want to place your buyout  provisions directly into the partnership or LLC operating agreement.

  To accomplish this, simply cut and paste the buyout provisions from our  CD-ROM into the existing organizational document (leaving out the  signature page). We recommend that you add them to the end of the  existing document, but you can insert them anywhere you wish. When  adding these provisions to the document, you will want to change the  paragraph numbering or lettering of the buyout provisions to conform to  the numbering or lettering scheme of your existing LLC operating  agreement or partnership agreement.

  

  Creating a Separate Agreement

  If you wish to adopt a separate buyout agreement, have all owners date and sign the agreement at the bottom, using the signature page included at  the end of the buyout agreement.

  TIP

  refer to your buyout agreement in your partnership or LLc

  

  operating agreement. If you adopt your buyout provisions in a separate buyout agreement, as we  suggest, we recommend that you add a provision to your partnership or  operating agreement that refers to the existence of your buyout  agreement. (Legally, this tactic is called “incorporating your buyout

  

  agreement by reference” into your partnership or operating agreement.) Doing this helps to cover your legal bases, and can help avoid a challenge to your buyout agreement from someone looking for a legal way out of its  enforceability.

  The provisions of the agreement among the owners dated [insert date of signing of your buyout agreement], which regulates the transfer

  of ownership interests in the [partnership/LLC] and other related matters, is hereby incorporated by reference into this [partnership agreement/LLC operating agreement] and shall be binding on the company, its creditors, its owners and  their assigns and successors, and other parties as provided in the  agreement.

  

  regulate the ownership of interests in the corporation. Here is one simple way to phrase this new provision.

  

  

  

  

  Reviewing Your LLC or Partnership Agreement

  Before finalizing your buyout provisions, you’ll need to make sure they mesh  well with the existing provisions of your partnership or LLC operating  agreement. Mostly, you want to check to make sure that an existing  provision in your partnership agreement or LLC operating agreement does  not prohibit, or impose additional rules on, any of the procedures  covered in your buyout provisions.

  For example, if your partnership agreement completely prohibits the  transfer of ownership interests, but your buyout provisions allow an  owner to sell to an outside buyer under certain circumstances, you will  want to amend your partnership agreement to delete the prohibition on  transfers. Similarly, if your LLC operating agreement prohibits an LLC  member from selling an LLC membership interest without the approval of  all nonselling members, but your buyout

  

  provisions allow a deceased owner’s estate to force the company to purchase the  deceased owner’s interest, you may want to remove the conflicting  restriction on transfers from your LLC operating agreement.

  Working out whether your buyout provisions are consistent with the other provisions in your partnership or operating agreement

  can get a bit legalistic. The reason for this is that state partnership and LLC laws contain default provisions—rules that apply in the absence of a contrary provision in the partnership or LLC operating agreement—that  affect ownership transfer rights in a partnership or LLC. Consequently,  many partnership and LLC agreements have

  adopted specific clauses that override or repeat the default state law, and  these clauses may conflict with your buyout provisions. Here are some of these special state-law-based provisions to look out for in a  partnership or LLC operating agreement:

  restrictions on transfer of full ownership rights. One common state default rule is that, in the absence of a contrary  provision in  a partnership or an LLC agreement, a person who is  transferred an

  ownership interest (the “transferee”) receives only economic rights in the  business—that is, a right to receive profits and any distribution of  cash or property made by the partnership or LLC. The transferee does not get any voting or other management rights attached to the interest  unless the nontransferring owners approve this at the time of transfer.  You will most likely want future transferees to get full ownership  rights—both economic and management rights—without having to obtain the  consent of all owners at the time of transfer. If you find a clause in  your partnership or operating agreement that requires the approval of  all owners for transfers of management rights, you’ll probably want to  delete it (or have a lawyer make our buyout provisions mesh with that  requirement).

  termination of business on dissociation of owner. This one is particularly legalistic. By law, in some states, absent a  contrary provision in the partnership or the LLC operating agreement,  the business legally dissolves when an owner is “dissociated”—this means when an owner transfers an interest, dies, withdraws, is

  

  expelled, files for bankruptcy, or otherwise ceases to hold an ownership  interest—unless the remaining owners vote to continue the business. If  you find this type of clause in your partnership

  or LLC operating agreement, you probably will want to delete it (after  asking a lawyer’s advice, to be safe). If you keep it in your agreement, it will conflict with our buyout provision that says the company does  not terminate when an owner is dissociated.

  SEE AN ExPERT

  pay a lawyer to help you check for legal consistency. Finding

  

  contradictions and inconsistencies between your buyout provisions and your partnership or LLC operating agreement is not always an easy task. This is one of  the times when it may make sense to pay a lawyer to do the difficult  work for you. When you ask a lawyer to review your draft buyout  agreement, also give the lawyer a copy of your partnership or LLC  operating agreement. The lawyer will know if there is any inconsistent  language in your partnership or operating agreement that needs to be  rooted out. You have to pay for this type of legal scrutiny, but we  think it’s worth it.

  

  Approving Changes to Your LLC or Partnership Agreement

  You and your co-owners will need to approve the additions to your  partnership or LLC operating agreement. All current owners should date  and sign the amended agreement. This new agreement that contains your  buyout provisions will be your new partner- ship or operating agreement. If spouses of the owners or any additional nonowners (such as LLC  managers) signed the original partnership or operating agreement, make  sure they sign the new agreement as well.

  Placing a Legend on Ownership Certificates

  Another task you may need to perform after adopting your buyout provisions is  to update your membership or ownership certificates. Usually, only  corporations issue ownership (stock) certificates to their owners.  However, some LLCs issue membership certificates to owners.

  Most states require the placement of a notice, or legend, on ownership  certificates whenever the interests they represent are subject to buyout provisions. This lets owners and outsiders know that interests in the  company are subject to restrictions and may be bought back by the  company and its owners pursuant to the buyout provisions that your  company has adopted.

  If your LLC issues membership certificates, for instructions on putting  the required legend on your certificates, see “Placing a Legend on Your  Certificates,” under “For Corporations,” above.

  

  Signing Your Agreement

  First, if you haven’t already, you should read Chapter 9 on income and estate  tax issues before making final decisions on your buyout provisions.  Then, assuming you have filled out the worksheet as you read this book,  you can now transfer the choices you marked on your worksheet to the  buyout agreement provided with this book on the tear-out form in  Appendix C or on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book.

  Next, we recommend you bring your draft agreement for review by a lawyer, tax expert, or other professional with experience in buyout agreements.  (See Chapter 10 on how to find an expert.)

  

  Finally, you’ve come to the last step in completing your agreement—signing it!  On the last page of our buyout agreement, you’ll find Section XI, which  contains blank lines for the signatures of the owners and their spouses. Have each owner and spouse print his or her name and the date in the  spaces provided, and then sign the agreement.

  

  Resolving Buyout Disputes in the Future

  Even the best buy-sell agreement—one that clearly and fairly covers every  possible eventuality—can’t guarantee a future free of disputes. Human  nature being what it is, if business owners are not on good terms during a buyout situation, one owner (or his inheritors or his ex-spouse) may  pick a fight with the others. And even if the owners are getting along  personally, it’s possible to disagree as to the value

  of a business interest. For example, a departing owner might assert the  purchase price the company has offered to pay him is unfairly low  because the valuation method in the agreement wasn’t properly followed.

  For these and other reasons, it makes sense to include a procedure in your  agreement for resolving conflicts. Then, if the owners can’t negotiate a solution or a compromise and a spat does ensue, all owners will have  the security of knowing there is a method in place to resolve the  dispute fairly and quickly and without having legal

  fees bankrupt all involved. To help meet these goals, our buyout agreement  provides a way to resolve disputes using “alternative dispute  resolution”—ADR for short.

  ADR is a catchall term that describes a number of methods used to resolve  disputes out of court, including negotiation, mediation, and  arbitration. The common denominator of all ADR methods is that they are  faster, less formal, cheaper, and often less adversarial than a court  trial. Our agreement utilizes the two most effective

  out-of-court mechanisms for resolving disputes: mediation and arbitration.

  

  Litigation

  First let’s take a look at how regular court litigation works (or doesn’t  work), if only to demonstrate why it’s often a poor choice for resolving small business disputes. First, if lawyers must be hired to represent  each side in a small business conflict, the resources of the company and the involved owners may quickly be drained. Simply put, legal fees can  be astronomical. To understand why, realize that business lawyers  usually charge $150 to $350 per hour—and a single case can take hundreds of hours of an attorney’s time in depositions and other trial  preparation before the case even goes to trial. In short, when you add  up the legal expenses of both sides, going to court can, and often does, cost more than the dispute is worth.

  Add to this the fact that litigation can drag on for months or even years,  during which time your business may be in limbo, and you have a true  recipe for disaster. In fact, many small businesses simply fall apart  before the court fight is over.

  Third, keeping conflicts out of a public courtroom can be important to small  business owners. Understandably, some don’t want to expose trade secrets or private financial information, or have to air their dirty laundry in public. For example, if you go to court over the buyout of a co-owner  who has a drug or alcohol abuse problem, some very personal matters  could be brought up, such as

  a recount of all the embarrassing things the owner did under the  influence. Revealing such information to the public could affect your  company’s reputation, not to mention ruin your business partner’s life.  Likewise, if you rely on consumers to buy products or services from you, you’ll want to keep up your public image. For instance, if one of your  co-owners becomes disabled in a tragic accident, and you and the other  co-owners attempt to buy him out, you could engender a wave of bad local publicity that could damage your business for years.

  Fourth, filing a lawsuit is a hostile and aggressive act. So as not to  jeopardize your case, your lawyers may forbid you to speak with opposing co-owners (even if you need and wish to cooperate to

  keep the business functioning). Also, your attorney may all but insist

  

  on using every means possible to win, even if it means showing your  co-owner in the worst possible light or dragging his family through the  mud. Of course, behavior like this is highly likely to cause your  adversary to retaliate in kind. Continuing your business relationship in circumstances like these is all but impossible.

  Fifth, many times small business disputes do not raise legal claims that can  be effectively pursued in court. For example, if two partners are in a  major disagreement about who should control different aspects of the  business, but there has been no violation of the partnership agreement,  chances are the co-owners won’t be able to resolve their problem in  court.

  Lastly, small businesses are particularly vulnerable to losing a court case.  They usually carry less comprehensive insurance and have less capital  than larger companies. As a result, they are at an increased risk of  being wiped out by even one oversized court award.

  

  Mediation

  Compared to litigation, mediation is inexpensive, quick, confidential, less  risky, and almost always available for small business disputes.

  In a nutshell, mediation is a process where the parties to a dispute try  to come to a voluntary agreement with the help of an outside, neutral  third party: the mediator. A mediation session is an informal process  that takes place without rules of evidence and other court- like  protocols (though it does follow a defined structure—see “The Stages of  Mediation,” below). With the help of their mediator, the parties decide  what issues need to be resolved and what procedure should be followed to solve their dispute.

  TIP

  All parties to a dispute must agree to mediation and be able to

  

  mediate. If one party refuses or perhaps isn’t competent to participate in  mediation, the dispute cannot be mediated. Particularly when one party  may be mentally disabled, you’d be better off going to court, where a  judge or lawyer can protect that party’s interests.

  The Stages of Mediation

  Many people think that mediation is a totally unstructured process in which a friendly mediator chats with the disputants until they suddenly drop  their hostilities and work together for the common good. In fact,  mediation is a carefully designed process intended to help the disputing parties craft a detailed written solution

  to their problem. True, compared to the formalism of an American trial court, mediation is informal, but that’s not a bad thing.

  Stage 1: Mediator’s opening Statement. After the disputants are seated at a table, the mediator introduces everyone, explains the goals and rules of the mediation, and encourages each side to work cooperatively toward a settlement.

  Stage 2: disputants’ opening Statements. Each party is invited to tell, in his or her own words, what the dispute is  about and how he or she has been affected by it, and to present some  general ideas about resolving it. While one person is speaking, the  other is not allowed to interrupt.

  Stage 3: Joint discussion. The mediator will try to get the parties to talk directly about what was  said in the opening statements. This is the time to determine what  issues need to be addressed.

  Stage 4: private Meetings With the Mediator (called “caucuses”). The private caucus is a chance for each party to meet privately with the  mediator (usually in a nearby room) to discuss the strengths and  weaknesses of his or her position and new ideas for settlement. The  mediator may caucus with each side just once or several times, as  needed. Often the mediator helps each party to focus on their

  real needs and to put aside less-essential issues. Although it may take  hours or even days, this eventually causes the parties to abandon  emotionally laden side issues and come to terms with the best way to  resolve the major issues.

  Stage 5: Joint negotiation. After the private caucuses, the mediator may bring the parties back together to negotiate directly.

  Stage 6: closure. This is the end of the mediation. If an agreement has been reached and the  parties are ready, they can write up and sign a legally binding  contract.

  Otherwise, the mediator may draw up a written summary of their agreement and  suggest they take it to lawyers for review. If no agreement was reached, the mediator will review whatever progress has been made and advise  each party of their options, such as meeting again later or going to  arbitration.

  

  Precisely because a mediator has no power to impose a decision, but encourages  the parties to arrive at their own compromised solution, participants  are usually more open to creative proposals to resolve a dispute than in a courtroom. In fact, partly because of this, business ownership  transition problems are quickly becoming a well- developed specialty in  the private dispute resolution world. Here are just a few of the many  other reasons why mediation is particularly well suited for business  disputes:

- Mediation costs a lot less than litigation. Fees start at $1,200 or so per party  for a full-day session, but can go higher, depending on how long  mediation lasts, how specialized your dispute is, and which firm or  mediator you choose. You should count on at least a couple of days for  small business mediation, maybe as much as a week or two if your dispute is complicated. Still, the cost will be a pittance compared to taking  the same dispute to court.

- Mediation spares the disputants the fear of the courtroom, where a judge or jury  can stun one party with a big loss. Because the mediator has no  authority to impose a decision, nothing can be decided unless both  parties agree to it. Knowing this greatly reduces the tension felt by  all parties— people in mediation tend to be more relaxed and open to  compromise. (If for any reason you don’t feel the mediation session is  productive, you can call it off. For instance, if one party isn’t  cooperating—he insists that he’s right and is not willing to hear the  other side, he doesn’t agree with the advantages of mediation, or he’s  just a loud-mouthed jerk— you may not want to waste any more time in  mediation, and instead go straight to arbitration. See “Arbitration,”  below.)

- People who arrive at a joint decision are much more likely to abide by it than are people who have a decision imposed on them by a judge. This is key  when an ongoing business is involved, since mediation greatly increases  the likelihood that the solution will actually work.

  

  - When you have to keep working with your co-owner (or a member of her family) and you want to remain on good terms, mediation is usually the best  choice. Unlike a judge, a

    mediator will not place blame. Just the opposite: A mediator’s job is to help  both parties evaluate their goals and options in order to find a  solution that works for everyone. For instance, during litigation, it’s  common to call a witness just to show the judge or jury the bad  character of the person you’re up against; in mediation this would be  completely irrelevant, and therefore is almost never done. And since  neither side needs to personally attack the other, each is able to save  face and, hopefully, continue some sort of business and personal  relationship with the other after the dispute is over.

  - Unlike court, mediation is not limited to solving the dispute at hand. Often,  issues are discussed in mediation that would not be legally relevant in  court, but which are highly important to the parties. This allows the  parties to address the issues that may have created the dispute in the  first place, including problems that stem from different communication  styles and clashing personalities. In short, if undiscovered or ongoing  problems surface during mediation, the parties, with the help of the  mediator, can work them out.

  - Mediation can be particularly helpful if you’re having trouble communicating and  negotiating with the other party; the mediator will help you make your  points and not allow the other side to intimidate you. In fact, even the experience of talking civilly to each other and working cooperatively  toward a solution can help business owners restore their relationship;  some consider mediation a kind of business therapy.

  - Mediation is also a good choice when you don’t want to air your company’s and  co-owners’ dirty laundry. Mediators take a vow of confidentiality so you can be assured that you won’t read about what your co-owner told your  media- tor about you in the local paper. Especially for family  businesses—where a contested court case can tear a family



apart—mediation is almost surely the better choice. Because of the privacy, the  civility, and the encouragement it provides to co-owners to come to a  compromise, mediation offers many distressed families a positive way to  begin a healing process that will go beyond the particular dispute.

To find a mediator, ask for recommendations from colleagues or small  business lawyers or associations, or look in your local Yellow Pages  under Mediation Services for a private dispute resolution company.

It’s important to choose a mediator with experience in small business  disputes, in particular in disputes arising out of buy-sell agreements.  And, in some situations, you may even want to seek out a mediator with  more specialized knowledge. For example, if your conflict is over the  value of an owner’s interest, then experience in business valuation  techniques or at least general financial know-how will be necessary.  Likewise, if you’re trying to structure a complicated installment  payment plan with an eye toward minimizing taxes, the mediator should  have some tax savvy. Or,

if you and your co-owners are arguing over the worth of a patent, the mediator should have a technical background.



Choosing a Mediator



When and if the parties do come up with a solution, the mediator should help them put the agreement in writing, usually as a legally binding  contract. The negotiated solution can include whatever you’ve agreed to, including issues not thought to be important when the mediation began.  For example, the agreement can set up a plan for you and the departing  owner to work together in the future (perhaps a retiring owner agrees to sell out as part of the settlement, but the company agrees that it will hire him to do consulting work for two years).





![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_181.png)

TIP

use experts as consultants. Small business lawyers or tax experts can also be used in a  consultative role as part of mediation. Often they make no appearances  at the mediation session itself, but stand by to review settlement  proposals. But be sure to have any experts you need lined up before you  begin mediating. When proposals start flying, you may need to have your  advisor at the ready to check them out, to recommend any necessary  changes, and to consider any tax consequences.



Arbitration

Arbitration, another form of alternative dispute resolution, is more like court than like mediation. Like mediation, arbitration uses a neutral third party, called an arbitrator (or sometimes, there are several neutral parties  that make up an arbitration panel). However, in binding arbitration, the parties themselves are not expected to arrive at a voluntary agreement  (although, of course, they are always free to do so). Instead, each side presents its version of the dispute to the arbitrator, who then issues a written decision that is binding on the parties.

Although arbitration is more structured and trial-like than mediation, the fact  that it uses relatively informal rules of evidence and procedure means  that it’s almost always faster than going to court. Also, arbitrators  have a bit more leeway than judges to impose commonsense solutions,  rather than being bound to follow the letter of the law. In short,  arbitration is almost always quicker and less expensive than going to  court, and definitely more private.

If an unhappy losing party decides to sue in court in an attempt to  overturn the arbitrator’s decision (in fact, such lawsuits occur  infrequently), she is almost sure to lose. That’s because the court will not overturn the arbitrator’s decision unless the arbitrator was  blatantly biased or unfair (for example, had an undisclosed conflict of  interest). In other words, once the arbitrator makes a decision, the  fight is over.



Our Solution

Arbitration is required by our buyout agreement only if negotiation and mediation  prove unsuccessful. In other words, disputants are encouraged to mediate first, arbitrate second (if necessary), and litigate not at all. In  fact, few disputes ever get past the mediation stage, because in  mediation disputants are highly motivated to arrive at a compromise they can live with, rather than risk that an arbitrator will impose a less  palatable one.

Section VIII: resolution of disputes

Mediation Followed by Arbitration

Except as may otherwise be provided in this agreement or a later one dated and signed by all owners, any dispute concerning the contents of this  agreement, if it cannot be settled through direct negotiation, shall  first be submitted to mediation according to the terms specified below.  All parties agree to try in good faith to settle the dispute by  mediation before resorting to arbitration or litigation.

1. An owner, an owner’s legal representative, the spouse or ex- spouse of an  owner, the executor or administrator of a deceased owner’s estate, or  any other party with an interest in this company who wishes to have a  dispute mediated shall submit a written request for mediation to each of the other owners of the company. Mediation shall commence within 15  days after the date of the written request for mediation.
2. Any decision reached by mediation shall be reduced to writing, signed by  all parties, and shall be binding on each party. The costs of mediation  shall be shared equally by all parties to the dispute.



The language of the dispute resolution clause we use in our buy- sell agreement is shown below.







![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_183.png)

1. Each party to the mediation process shall cooperate fully and fairly with  the mediator in any attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory compromise  to a dispute. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days after it is  referred to the mediator, the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration according to the terms specified below or on terms agreeable to all  parties at the time the dispute is submitted to arbitration.

2. Within 15 days of the delivery of the notice of intention to proceed to  arbitration to all parties, each party shall reply in writing to the  arbitrator, stating his or her views of the nature and appropriate  outcome of the dispute.

3. The arbitrator shall hold a hearing on the dispute within 15 days after  replies have been received from all parties or, if all replies have not  been received, no later than 30 days after the giving of notice of  intention to proceed to arbitration.

4. At the arbitration hearing, each party shall be entitled to present any  oral or written statements he or she wishes and may present witnesses.  The arbitrator shall make his or her decision in writing, and his or her decision shall be conclusive and binding on all parties to the dispute.

5. The cost of arbitration, including any lawyer’s fees, shall be borne by the parties to the dispute equally unless the arbitrator directs otherwise.

   CAUTION

   our dispute resolution clause is not optional. We assume all

   

   readers will agree in their buyout agreement to attempt to mediate their  disputes and, if mediation fails, to arbitrate instead of going directly to court. Of course, you can change this provision, for example, by not requiring arbitration if mediation fails, but we don’t think this is  the best course—for the reasons given earlier, a court case should be  avoided if at all possible.

   

   Binding Future Owners Under Your Buyout Agreement

   The next section of our buyout agreement, Section X, tries to ensure that  new owners in the company will be legally bound to the terms of the  buyout agreement. While the agreement states that all future holders of  ownership interests—whether they have received an interest by sale,  gift, will or trust, or otherwise—will be subject

   to the terms of the buyout agreement, new owners must sign the agreement or they may not actually be legally bound to follow it.

   

   exAMpLe: George and Harry have owned and managed a mortuary for 40 years as a  corporation. Having bought the building that houses the mortuary and  owning a large share of a local cemetery, the business has come to be  worth a lot of money. Getting on in years, George starts to gift shares  to his children, hoping to avoid eventual estate taxes. George does not  require his children to sign the company’s shareholder (buy-sell)

   agreement before receiving shares. Soon after receiving shares in the  corporation, George’s son Michael decides he doesn’t want to follow in  his father’s footsteps to become an undertaker, so he sells his shares  to one of George and Harry’s competitors. Since Michael never signed the agreement, it would be very hard, if not impossible, to get a judge to  void the transfer of shares.

   

   Other problems can arise if a recipient of an ownership interest never signs  the agreement. If, for instance, Michael from the above example gets  divorced and his spouse receives half of his ownership interest in a  divorce settlement, the company cannot require the spouse to sell her  ownership interest back to the company.

   For this reason, any time family members receive interests in the company  by gift, they, as well as their spouses, should be required to adopt the agreement.

   Our agreement requires all new owners, and their spouses, to sign the  buyout agreement before taking an ownership interest in the company.  Section X from our buyout agreement is shown below.

   

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_185.gif)

   

   Section x: continuation of restrictions

   All heirs, successors and assigns to an ownership interest in the company will be bound by the terms of this agreement.

   Before receiving a purchased, donated, or otherwise transferred interest from  an owner or an owner’s legal representative, the owner or the owner’s  legal representative will require any purchaser, donee or transferee,  and his or her spouse, to sign this agreement, agreeing to be bound by  its terms.

   

   In the future, whenever a new owner joins your company, add this owner’s  name (and her spouse’s name, if applicable) to your buyout agreement,  and have the new owner sign it. You can simply add a new date and  signature line at the bottom of your original agreement for the new  owner to date and sign, or you can prepare a new one, having all old and new owners sign it. This latter approach gives you a chance to review  your agreement to make sure it still works for all owners. For example,  if the economic circumstances of your corporation or the personal  preferences of your owners have changed since the adoption of your  agreement, you may want to change the valuation and payment alternatives in Sections VI and VII of the agreement. (See the next section for  information on updating your agreement.)

   

   Updating Your Agreement

   As we have discussed elsewhere, it’s important to review your agreement  periodically to make sure it reflects the current economic realities of  your company and the present expectations of your owners. It is  particularly important to review Sections VI and VII

   of the agreement, where you check the methods to be used to value  ownership interests and the payment terms to pay for them for purposes  of a buyout under your agreement. Some experts recommend doing this each year, at the owners’ annual meeting.

   

   If all owners agree to make changes to the buyout agreement, you can date  and have all owners initial changes on the original agreement itself, or you can prepare a new one and have it dated and signed by all owners.

   

   Updating the Agreement Price

   There’s another way to update your valuation provision if you have selected the fixed-price valuation method (Valuation Method 1) in Section VI (see  Chapter 6). This provision lets you change the buyout price to be paid  for interests by having all owners sign a written statement that  specifies a new agreed-upon price. Below is a sample statement you can  copy and use for this purpose.

   If you use a written statement like this, be sure to attach it to your agreement.

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_186.png)

   TIP

   update your price whenever your financial outlook changes.

   

   Even if you and your co-owners do not sign a new statement annually, make  sure to do so whenever financials in your business take a significant  upturn or downturn (for instance, your payroll costs increase  significantly, with a resulting reduction in owners’ equity as shown on  your last fiscal year-end

   balance sheet, or your annual profits go up significantly three quarters in a row and you expect this trend to continue).

   Owners’ Consent to New Agreement Price for Interests in the Company

   The undersigned owners of [name of company], representing all of the voting owners on the books of this company on  the date shown below, agree that in any purchase or sale of ownership  interests under the buy-sell agreement dated [date of signing of your agreement], unless otherwise stated in a provision of such agreement other than  Section VI, for the purposes of determining the purchase price for  individual ownership interests, the entire

   value of the company shall be $ [insert agreed-upon price for entire company, such as “100,000”]. The value of an individual owner’s interest shall be the entire value  for the company as determined under this paragraph, multiplied by his or her ownership percentage.

   The price stated in this statement shall supersede any price specified in  Section VI of the above-mentioned agreement, and shall supersede any  price specified in any statement dated and signed by owners prior to the date of this statement, shown below.

   Dated: Signed: [*signatures of all current owners*]

   

   Updating the Funding Method

   If you revisit your agreement to add insurance funding in a few years, you may also need to change these parts of your agreement:

   - Section III, Scenario 2 and/or Scenario 3 (buyout options)

   - Section V (funding)

   - Section VI (price), and

   - Section VII (payment terms).

     

     Make sure your agreement coincides with the terms of your insurance policy, or you may have trouble with the insurance payoff.

     RELATED TOPIC

     don’t forget to add new owners to your agreement, as discussed in “Binding Future owners under Your Buyout Agreement,” above. You can simply add a new date and signature line at the bottom of your  original agreement for the new owner to date and sign, or you can  prepare a new one, having all old and new owners sign it. ●

     ax consequences are obviously important whenever business interests are  transferred. And the adoption of particular provisions in your buyout  agreement as well as the actual

     buyout of an owner’s interest according to those provisions can have important income and estate tax consequences. For this reason, it

     is important to have your buyout agreement reviewed by a skilled tax  adviser to make sure that a buyout will have the appropriate tax  consequences for the seller, buyers, inheritors and other people  intended to benefit from a buyout under your agreement.

     In this chapter, we flag some of the basic federal income and estate tax  issues involved with buyouts of ownership interests in partnerships,  LLCs, and corporations and try to explain them. The tax implications of  buyout provisions and the tax consequences of using a particular buyout  method are complicated, and we don’t cover all the rules and  exceptions—just enough to give you a good start when seeking more  specific, individually tailored and up-to- date advice from your tax  adviser. And remember, even the basic rules here are subject to change

     

     Income Tax Issues

     Let’s start by looking at some of the fundamental income tax issues surrounding a buyout of an owner’s interest.

     Before we get into the tax treatment of buyouts, let’s define a technical tax  term that you need to know—the concept of “income tax basis” in an  ownership interest. Then we’ll discuss how the continuing owners, the  selling owner, and the company are taxed following a buyout.

     

     Tax Basis and Capital Gains

     As you may or may not know, the term income tax basis, or simply basis,  refers to the value assigned to property for the purposes of determining the taxable gain or loss from it after it is sold. When

     

     you sell an ownership interest, calculating your exact basis (with the help of a tax adviser) is crucial, because this is the number that the IRS  uses to determine if you’ve made a profit (“recognized a gain,” in  IRS-speak).

     Generally, your income tax basis in an ownership interest is the cash amount you  pay, along with your current basis in any property you transfer, to buy  the interest. If you transfer property that’s subject to a debt that the business assumes—for example, you transfer real estate subject to a  mortgage—your basis in your interest is decreased by the amount of the  assumed debt. In addition, in a partnership or LLC, if the business has  any outstanding accounts payable or other business debts when you make  your capital contribution, your share of these liabilities is added to  your basis (since you are personally liable for the debts of the  business).

     Over time, this original basis in your ownership interest is adjusted up or  down. For example, in a partnership or an LLC, your basis in your  ownership interest is increased when profits are allocated to you, and  decreased when losses are allocated. These allocations occur  automatically at the end of the tax year of the partnership or LLC  whether or not profits are actually paid out, and are known as each  owner’s “distributive share.” In addition, your basis in an LLC or  partnership interest is decreased whenever you receive a cash  distribution from the business—for example, when profits are actually  paid to you (unless the distributions exceed your basis in your  interest). In addition, your basis interest normally increases whenever  the business incurs additional liabilities (for example, takes out a  loan).

     Obviously, figuring your basis in an ownership interest during the course of its  operations or at the time of a buyout of your ownership interest is  anything but obvious to most of us, and this is just one of the  important tasks that should be referred to a tax adviser.

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_190.png)

     TIP

     There are different types of bases in partnership and LLc

     

     ownership interests. In a partnership or an LLC, there are two types of basis: the owner’s  individual basis in an ownership interest—called the “outside basis”—and the partnership or LLC’s separate basis in its assets—called its  “inside basis.” In our discussion of basis in this section, when we  refer to a partner’s or an LLC member’s basis in her ownership interest, we mean the partner’s or LLC member’s “outside basis” in her interest.

     

     Your gain when you sell your ownership interest is calculated by subtracting your tax basis in your ownership interest (your original basis plus or  minus adjustments) from your sale proceeds. In general, the higher your  basis, the lower your gain will be for tax purposes.

     

     exAMpLe: Barbara is a shareholder and vice president of Biz Wiz, a small corporation  with four other owners. As part of its initial stock issuance, Barbara’s company issues her 3,000 shares in exchange for her cash payment of  $70,000 plus the

     patent she owns for *Biz Wiz* software. Her starting basis consists of her patents of $30,000 plus her cash payment of $70,000:

     $100,000. When Barbara leaves the company four years later, no adjustments have  been made to her original basis in her shares. Under the terms of the  buyout provisions in the shareholder agreement signed by Barbara and her co-owners, her ownership interests are appraised and purchased by the  company for

     $125,000. Barbara recognizes a gain of $25,000—the $125,000 sales price minus her basis of $100,000 in her shares.

     

     You can expect to pay a tax on any gain you make when you sell your  ownership interest. In most cases, your profit should be eligible to be  taxed at capital gains tax rates. The capital gains rates vary according to how long you owned your ownership interest—for the long term (which  is more than one year), or for the short term (which is one year or  less). Without listing the various capital gains rates, which depend on  your personal income tax bracket and

     

     change regularly, the main point is this: Long-term capital gains rates are  normally lower than ordinary individual income rates paid by the owners, so it’s usually an advantage to have the profit from a sale of an  ownership interest taxed at long-term capital gains rates.

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_191.png)

     Capital Accounts

     The term capital account refers to the dollar value of a partner’s or an  LLC member’s interest in the business (not counting any depreciation or  goodwill). It is easy to confuse capital account balances with other  accounting and tax terms, such as an owner’s basis in his interest or  his distributive share of profits and losses. To avoid this, just think  of a capital account balance as the amount that an owner can expect

     to be paid if the business is liquidated and split up among the owners  (assuming there is sufficient cash left after all creditors have been  paid).

     When a partner or an LLC member contributes cash or property to a company,  her capital account is credited with the cash amount or fair market  value of the contribution. When profits are allocated to the owner at  the end of the tax year of a partnership or an LLC, her

     capital account balance goes up (but the business owes this money); as  distributions are made, such as payments of draws, or profits, her  capital account balance goes down (the business no longer owes this  money).

     In fact, an owner’s capital account balance may be used in a partner- ship or an LLC operating agreement as the price an owner receives for a  buyout of the owner’s interest. As long as the assets of the partnership or LLC are appraised and adjusted on the balance sheet of the company  just prior to the buyout (for example, an increase in assets results in  proportionate increases to the balances in the owners’ capital  accounts), payment of the capital account balance to a departing owner  can represent a fair value for her interest. If you’re interested in  using this method to value ownership interests in an LLC or a  partnership, choose the appraisal method in Chapter 6—a professional  appraiser can handle these calculations for you.

     

     exAMpLe: Let’s revisit Barbara’s situation. After owning her Biz Wiz shares (in which  her tax basis is $100,000) for several years, Barbara sells them back to Biz Wiz for $125,000. Her $25,000 profit is eligible for long-term  capital gains treatment, rather than ordinary income tax treatment. Had  Barbara’s sale not qualified for capital gains tax rates, she would have been taxed on the sale proceeds at her higher personal income tax rate.

     Special exclusions may be available. Shareholders in qualifying

     

     active C corporations may be able to exclude 50% of the capital gain realized  from selling originally issued shares if they were held for more than  five years. If you are a shareholder of a C corporation, ask your tax  adviser about this possibility.

     

     Okay, we’ve established that capital gains tax treatment is normally the way  to go when selling an ownership interest. And we’ve also seen that  having a higher basis in your ownership interest results in the  recognition of less capital gain and, therefore, the payment of less tax when the interest is sold. Below, we discuss special IRS rules that  affect the basis of an ownership interest and your eligibility for  capital gains tax treatment when your ownership interest is bought out  under a buyout agreement.

     

     Tax Treatment for Continuing Owners

     In Chapter 4, we discussed why our buyout agreement allows the company and then the continuing owners the opportunity to purchase a departing  owner’s interest. A big advantage of this approach is that the decision  as to who will make the purchase

     doesn’t have to be made until a particular buyout situation presents itself.  This allows the owners of the company to evaluate the tax advantages and disadvantages of several different buyout scenarios. The decision as to whether to have the company or the continuing owners purchase an  ownership interest can have significant tax

     

     consequences. We look briefly at some of these tax consequences below.

     

     Continuing Owners as Buyers

     Let’s start by focusing on a simple truth: When the continuing owners buy a  departing co-owner’s interest, they have spent additional personal funds to increase their ownership interest in their company, and their  percentages of ownership in the company increase accordingly.

     

     exAMpLe: Amanda, Beth, Chris, and their father each own 15,000 shares in Shortcuts, Inc. They each own 25% of the company. When their father decides to retire,  Amanda, Beth, and Chris buy his 15,000 shares (the corporation does not  buy any shares itself). According to their buy-sell agreement, the  children split the purchase of the shares equally, buying 5,000 shares  apiece. Amanda, Beth, and Chris now each own 20,000 shares. They each  own 33% of the company, instead of 25%.

     

     It follows that each continuing owner’s tax basis in her ownership  interest will increase by the amount of cash she paid to buy the  departing owner’s shares.

     

     exAMpLe: Let’s fill in the details of the Shortcuts example above. Amanda, Beth, and  Chris each have a basis of $15,000 in their original shares—that is,  each paid $15,000 to buy their original 15,000 shares. When their father decides to retire, Amanda,

     Beth, and Chris each pay him $5,000 for 5,000 of his shares. Amanda, Beth,  and Chris now own 20,000 shares each (33% of the company), and each has a basis of $20,000 in her larger ownership interests.

     

     This type of direct purchase by the continuing owners lets the owners  increase their bases in their ownership interests so that in the future, when one of them wants to sell the shares, there will be

     

     less of a taxable gain (less difference between tax basis and the sales price) and therefore the less capital gains tax to pay.

     Of course, unless life and disability insurance will fund a buyout, the  continuing owners will normally have to use personal funds

     or borrow money to purchase a departing owner’s interest. Or, if a  shareholder has to take dividends from his corporation to fund the  buyout, the funds will be subject to double taxation—once as income to  the corporation, and again when received by the share- holder.  Similarly, partners or LLC members will be taxed when taking draws from  their businesses to fund buyouts (a draw is an advance distribution of  profits by a partnership or an LLC and is

     taxed to owners at their individual income tax rates). In short, these  additional considerations demonstrate that the decision as to who buys a departing ownership interest—the company or the continuing owners—is a  complex one where input from a tax expert is necessary.

     CAUTION

     Watch out for tax terminations. If the continuing owners of a

     

     partnership or an LLC buy out a majority owner, the business may terminate for tax  purposes. See “Income Tax Termination of Partnerships and LLC’s,” below, for further details.

     

     Company as Buyer

     When the company itself buys a co-owner’s interest, it’s a slightly  different story, although the continuing owners’ percentages of  ownership in the company increase just the same. Let’s see what happens  to Amanda, Beth, and Chris in this situation.

     

     exAMpLe: Amanda, Beth, Chris, and their father each own 15,000 shares in Shortcuts, Inc., or 25% of the company.

     When their father decides to retire, the corporation buys back (redeems) the father’s 15,000 shares and cancels them. Although Amanda, Betty, and  Chris still only own 15,000 shares apiece, they now each own 33% of the  company.

     

     When a company buys back a departing owner’s interest, whether it’s a  corporation, an LLC, or a partnership, each continuing owner ends up  owning a larger fraction of the company, since there are fewer owners.  And, assuming the business stays on a steady course, each owner’s larger share can be sold for more than would have been true before one owner  sold out.

     However, from a tax point of view, when the company itself buys a departing  owner’s interest, the continuing owners’ tax bases do not go up, since  the owners did not actually purchase any part  of an interest or invest  more dollars. The result is that the continuing owners may owe higher  capital gains taxes when they eventually sell their interests than if  they had personally bought the departing owner’s interest themselves.

     For this reason, if a co-owner wants to be bought out, you and your  co-owners may want to buy the co-owner’s share yourselves, rather than  having the company pay for it. But this decision isn’t usually this  simple. After all, the higher capital gains taxes could well be less  than the money the continuing owners would save by not purchasing the  departing owner’s interest themselves.

     Also key to the decision of whether the company or the continu- ing owners  should purchase a departing or deceased owner’s interest is whether the  sale proceeds will be taxed as a capital gain to the *seller*. We look at this issue in the next section.

     

     Tax Treatment for the Selling Owner

     First, the good news: Generally, when an owner sells an ownership interest,  whether it be shares in a corporation or an ownership interest in a  partnership or an LLC, the sale is eligible for capital gains tax  treatment (which saves tax dollars, as discussed above). But, of course, there are technical tax requirements and exceptions to this rule. When  the time comes for a buyout, you will want to talk to a tax adviser to  make sure your sale or purchase of an interest actually qualifies for  long-term capital gains treatment. Let’s look at some of the general  rules for corporations, partnerships, and LLCs.

     

     Buyouts of Partnerships and LLC Interests

     While most buyouts by the continuing owners qualify the selling owner for  capital gains tax treatment, when the partnership or LLC buys out an  owner, things aren’t so certain.

     continuing owners as Buyers. When the continuing owners buy out a departing owner in a partnership or an  LLC, any gain on the sale is normally taxed to the selling owner at  long-term capital gains tax rates. Also included in the sale and taxed  to the selling owner is the owner’s share of any partnership or LLC  liabilities. Finally, at the time of sale the basis of a partner or an  LLC member is adjusted up or down for the amount of profit or loss  allocable to the owner for the portion of the tax year prior to the  sale.

     

     exAMpLe: Maria sells her partnership interest to her partner for

     $25,000. Her basis in her interest was $15,000, and her half of partnership  liabilities is $5,000. At the time of the sale, Maria’s share of  partnership profits for the current tax year is $1,000. Maria’s adjusted basis is $16,000—her $15,000 basis adjusted up by $1,000 for her share  of current-year profits. Her taxable gain is thus $14,000 ($25,000  selling price plus her $5,000 share of partnership liabilities, minus  her $16,000 adjusted basis). Maria will owe capital gains taxes on  $14,000.

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_194.png)

     CAUTION

     exceptions to capital gain rules. If a portion of the purchase

     

     price is allocated to “unrealized receivables” (rights to payments by the  business for past or future services) or substantially appreciated  inventory (inventory whose market value exceeds 120% of its basis), that portion is taxed at ordinary income rates to the selling owner, rather  than given capital gains treatment. Also, if any portion of the purchase price is a payment for the goodwill of the business, it will be taxed  at ordinary income tax rates, unless a written agreement specifically  provides for the payment of goodwill.

     

     company as Buyer. When the business itself—not the continuing owners—purchases the interest of a departing owner (called a “liquidation” of the owner’s interest),  capital gains treatment for the seller’s gain is not a sure thing. The  selling owner may be eligible for capital gains tax treatment on her  gain from the sale or she may have to pay ordinary income taxes on the  sale proceeds. Tax analysts

     see this as a tax flexibility afforded partnerships and LLCs—the business  can structure the liquidation of an owner’s interest by the partnership  or LLC any way it wants to. However, if the seller has to pay a 28% to  35% tax on the sale proceeds, he may be less thrilled at that prospect.

     Here’s a quick look at the three ways a partnership or an LLC can treat  buyouts for tax purposes when the business itself buys the business:

   - If a buyout of the interest of a retiring or deceased owner qualifies  under Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) Section 736(b) as an “exchange for  an interest,” the payment should receive capital gains treatment.  Capital gains taxes are due on the amount by which the sales price  exceeds the owner’s basis in the interest.

   - If the payments for an ownership interest are determined with reference to the income of the business, they may be considered a payment to a  partner of her distributive share— that is, her share of profits in the  partnership or LLC. In this case, the selling owner (or his estate) will owe ordinary income taxes on the entire sales price. The distributive   shares allocable to the remaining partners are reduced (this is similar  to the partnership getting a deduction for the payment).

   - If the sale is considered by the IRS as a “guaranteed payment,” the selling owner pays ordinary income taxes on *all* of the sale proceeds (not just the amount by which the purchase price  exceeds the owner’s basis). The partnership is entitled to a deduction  for the amount paid.



We won’t cover the technical requirements and exceptions to the above  rules. Just make sure to have your tax advisor analyze potential and  future buyouts under your buyout provisions to make sure you will obtain the desired tax result when and if the time comes for the buyout of an  owner’s interest by your partnership

or LLC.

CAUTION

Ask your tax adviser about goodwill payments. If you plan to



include goodwill in your buyout price, you may wish to amend your partner- ship or LLC operating agreement to specifically provide for a reasonable  payment to a selling owner for his share of goodwill in the business.  (This way, a selling owner shouldn’t have to pay ordinary income tax  rates on the portion of the buyout price allocated to goodwill.)

Your tax adviser can help you decide if you should do this and can add the  necessary language to your agreement to meet the tax rules. (Even though courts have allowed retroactive amendments to partnership agreements to include this language after a buyout, we recommend you make any  necessary changes prior to effecting a buyout under your buyout  provisions.)



Buyouts of Corporate Shares

The good news is that most buyouts of a corporate shareholder’s entire  ownership interest should qualify for capital gains tax treat- ment by  the owner (or his estate). But, again, there are technical exceptions  you should go over with a tax adviser if you think they may apply to  you.

continuing owners as buyers. When the continuing shareholders buy out a departing owner, the transaction  should qualify for capital gains tax treatment: The selling owner pays  capital gains taxes on the excess of the sales price over his basis in  the interest.

corporation as buyer. There are more than a few tax wrinkles that arise if the corporation is the  buyer. When the corporation itself buys a departing or deceased owner’s  shares, it is called a “redemption.”



Here’s the basic rule: If a redemption by the corporation of an owner’s shares qualifies under I.R.C. § 302 as an “exchange,” then capital gains tax  rules apply. The selling owner (or his estate) pays capital gains taxes  on the amount by which the sales proceeds exceed his basis in the  transferred shares.

If the buyout does not qualify as an exchange, the payout is treated and  taxed as a dividend. Even though the long-term capital gains rate and  the dividends rate are currently the same, dividend treatment is a  disadvantage because the entire dividend payment is subject to tax. (In  an exchange, only the amount of the sales proceeds that exceed the  seller’s basis is subject to tax.) Therefore,

a seller or his estate will no doubt want the buyout to qualify as an exchange under the tax rules.

Fortunately, most buyout scenarios qualify as exchanges, and are therefore eligible  for capital gains tax treatment. But watch out for either of the  following circumstances when your corporation redeems stock under your  buyout agreement:

- The corporation buys less than all of an owner’s interest. This could happen if your corporation is exercising its Right

  of First Refusal under your agreement to purchase shares offered by a  shareholder to an outsider, but the outsider is planning to buy less  than all of the shareholder’s stock. In this case, the corporation has a right to buy less than all the shares of the selling shareholder. This  purchase would not automatically qualify as an exchange. Also, if the  continuing shareholders buy some of a departing owner’s shares, the  corporation is buying less than all the shares of an owner, and the  transaction won’t automatically qualify as an exchange.

- The corporation is a family business. Even if the corporation purchases all the shares of a departing owner, it  might not be purchasing her entire interest under the technical

definition of an exchange. That’s because the rules say that shares owned by an  owner’s relatives (spouse, children, grandchildren, and parents) will be attributed to the



owner. Unless the corporation buys out all of the owner’s shares plus all  shares owned by the owner’s relatives, the redemption does not  automatically qualify as an exchange.

If you are concerned about a corporate buyout of shares not automatically  qualifying as an exchange—because the corporation is buying less than  all the owner’s shares or because relatives of the owner will own shares in the corporation after the buyout, talk to your tax advisor. There  are some special rules that still allow the purchase to qualify as an  exchange (for example, a partial buyout of a deceased shareholder’s  shares to pay his estate taxes may qualify for capital gains treatment). We discuss this exception further in “Partial Buybacks to Pay Estate  Taxes,” below. We won’t go into the details of these other special rules here. Just be aware of the basic requirement for capital gains  treatment stated above and, if you anticipate problems or want more  information, ask your tax advisor for more information about these  special tax rules.



Estate Planning

While most estate planning relating to buyouts involves avoiding estate  taxes, which we’ll discuss later, you can also save your heirs income  taxes by leaving your business interest to them in a tax- savvy way.

In general, assuming your business interest has appreciated since you  formed your business or bought into it, it can be smarter to leave your  business interest to your inheritors upon your death rather than selling or giving it to them shortly before your death.

Here’s why.



Stepped-Up Basis at Death of Owner

When you leave a business interest to someone at death, either by will or by a probate-avoiding living trust, the inheritor’s tax basis in the  property becomes equal to its fair market value as of the date of your  death (up to a limit of $1.3 million, in 2010). Because fair market  value at the date of your death is likely to be higher than



your original tax basis in the interest (assuming appreciation over the  years), it is often said that at death the tax basis of a business  interest is “stepped up” to its fair market value. (This is actually a  simplification of the rule, because the basis of inherited property is  adjusted up or down to its fair market value as of the date of death.)  This adjusted-value rule can save your heirs a lot in taxes.



exAMpLe: Bill paid $25,000 for an ownership interest in BJB, a company he owns along  with his wife and her brother. His company’s buy-sell agreement allows  an owner to leave his ownership interest to whomever he wishes in his  will, and that inheritor has the right to force BJB to buy back the  ownership interest at its current fair market value (to be established  by a

professional appraiser). Bill dies, leaving his ownership interests to his daughter, Amy.

Forty days after her father’s death, Amy demands that BJB buy back the  interest she recently inherited. BJB gets an appraisal for Bill’s  interest for $200,000 and buys it from Amy

for this amount. Amy does not owe any capital gains or income taxes, since  at Bill’s death her income tax basis in the ownership interest was  automatically stepped up to the fair market value

of $200,000, and her sale proceeds were also $200,000. (If her basis in  the ownership interest had not been stepped up, but had stayed at Bill’s original basis of $25,000, Amy would have had to report and pay taxes  on capital gains of $175,000 when she sold her ownership interest back  to BJB.)



Before 2010. Before January 1, 2010, all of a person’s property got the “stepped-up” basis  when the person died—the value of the property on the date of the  person’s death. As a result, when the inheritor sold the property, the  inheritor paid capital gains tax based on the value of the property as  of the date of death.

during 2010. If you die during 2010, or at least until a new law is passed in 2010,  your inheritors can take a maximum of $1.3 million in property at a  stepped-up basis. If your estate has more than

$1.3 million in property, it’s up to your executor to decide which



items get a stepped-up basis. If an item doesn’t get a stepped-up basis, its  basis remains what it was for you during your lifetime. This is usually  what you paid for the property, plus adjustments for investments you  made in the property. The amount of your inheritors’ capital gains tax  will be based on your basis, which is almost always lower than its fair  market value, meaning your inheritor will owe more tax when the property is sold.

For example, suppose your child inherits your house, for which you paid  $100,000 many years ago, and it’s worth $400,000 at your death. If your  child sells it for $410,000 a year after your death, your child’s  taxable gain under the pre-2010 rules would be just $10,000. Under the  new rules, if the house doesn’t get a stepped-up basis because other  property in your estate is given the $1.3 million in stepped-up basis,  your child’s taxable gain on the sale of the house would be $300,000.  Again, this is only a problem if your executor gives the stepped-up  basis to some other property in your estate, such as a small business.

Fortunately, surviving spouses can take another $3,000,000 in stepped-up basis, in  addition to the $1.3 million in stepped-up basis that all inheritors  get.

After 2010. No one knows for sure whether the $1.3 million limit to stepped-up basis  will stay, go away, or change altogether, and when it will change, but  chances are that Congress will address

[it  sometime in 2010, when it is expected to pass new estate tax  legislation. If Congress does not act, the $1.3 million limitation on  stepped-up basis (plus $3 million for surviving spouses) will go away  December 31, 2010.

CAUTION

other issues may be important in the sale or transfer of your



business interest. Here we just demonstrated the general rule that property receives a  stepped-up basis at death. But, in some cases, if a business is very  valuable today but faces much uncertainty in the years ahead, waiting to



transfer an ownership interest at death in order to save on taxes may be a poor  choice. In short, you’ll need to assess your business prospects, family  needs, and tax situation to decide the optimum time and manner to sell  or transfer your small business interest.



No Change of Basis for Gifts of Interests

When you give away an ownership interest, you give it away at *your* tax basis, not at the interest’s fair market value when you make the gift.  Unfortunately, the stepped-up basis rule does not apply to gifts. If you give away all or part of your business interest during your lifetime,  the person who receives the interest will take it at the same tax basis  as yours was when you made the gift.



exAMpLe: Let’s go back to Bill and Amy’s situation. Imagine that instead of waiting to leave his ownership interest in BJB to Amy upon his death, Bill gives  it to Amy while he’s living. Amy takes the interest at Bill’s basis of  $25,000. Several years later, after Bill dies, Amy sells her interest  for $200,000. Unfortunately, instead of owing no capital gains tax, as  would be true if Bill

had waited and left his share of BJB to Amy at his death (her tax basis in  BJB would have been stepped up to its current market value of $200,000), Amy owes a whopping capital gains tax. In the eyes of the IRS, she has  realized a taxable gain of $175,000 ($200,000 – $25,000).



It follows that, if you’re an elderly owner, it may not make sense to give away interests in your business to family members during your lifetime. Instead, it may make better sense to wait until your death to leave  your ownership interest to your heirs, who will then inherit it with a  basis equal to its stepped-up fair market value (subject to any limits  in place at the time of your death). If they sell it soon after  receiving it, they may not have to pay capital gains tax.

However, if your children work in the business and plan to succeed you some day, this may not apply. In this case, they’ll be taking over their share of the company on a long-term basis, and no capital gains tax will be due  for many years.



Income Tax Termination of Partnerships and LLCs

A tax trap related to buyouts is that they can trigger a “tax termina-  tion” of a partnership or an LLC. (Corporations continue legally and for tax purposes despite any changes in ownership.)

First, let’s distinguish a “legal termination” of a partnership or an LLC from a tax termination. Under state statutes, a partnership or an LLC might  legally terminate when an owner dies, leaves, or otherwise transfers an  ownership interest, or when a new owner is admitted into the partnership or LLC. A legal termination is mostly just a nuisance and means the  remaining or newly constituted

owners should adopt a new partnership or LLC operating agreement, specifying  the owners’ capital, profits, loss, and management rights and  responsibilities. (If an owner leaves the business, it can make sense to create a new agreement, anyway.) The main point is that the business of the partnership or LLC, and its financial and tax operations, can stay  on a steady course even if the partnership or LLC is legally terminated.

In addition, there is a way some partnerships and LLCs can easily avoid  legal termination. Partnerships in states that have adopted the Revised  Uniform Partnership Act, as well as LLCs in most states, can avoid this  legal termination rule by stating in a written agreement that the  partnership or LLC legally continues despite changes in ownership. Our  operating agreement states this in its introduction.

There are situations, however, where a buyout of an owner can trigger a *tax* termination, and this is a more serious problem. This applies only when the  continuing partners or LLC members buy out a departing majority owner.

Specifically, Section 708 of the Internal Revenue Code says that a partnership or LLC is terminated for tax purposes if, within a

1. month period, there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total  interests in partnership or LLC capital and profits. Fortunately,  buyouts by the partnership or LLC itself do not count; nor do large  transfers of interests by gift, will, or inheritance. However, large  buyouts by the continuing partners or LLC members do count.

   

   Here’s the problem: If the continuing owners buy out the interest of a  majority owner, the partnership or LLC is terminated for tax purposes,  which means the books of the company are closed and

   all assets are considered to have been distributed to the continuing  partners or LLC members, who then are assumed to have put these  distributed assets into a new partnership or LLC. *The tax effect of  this type of forced tax termination can be enormous and costly, so you  will want to make sure you do not run afoul of this tax provision when  you effect a buyout under your agreement.* Well in advance of any buyout, ask your accountant for additional information to avoid triggering this tax provision.

   don’t ignore state tax issues. Some states tax transfers of owner- ship interests. In a few states, a sales tax may even apply to sales of business assets. And, of course, many  states and localities impose transfer taxes on real estate or other  assets. Be sure to ask your tax adviser about your state’s taxes.

   

   Estate Tax Issues

   If your enterprise is profitable, your estate—all the real estate and  personal property you own when you die, including your ownership  interest—may be subject to estate tax, if there is an estate tax in  existence when you die. This may make you a candidate to engage in at  least basic estate planning, which simply means planning how to pass  along your property at death in the most efficient and cost- effective  way. Often, the primary estate planning concern for small business  owners is passing their ownership interest to the next generation with  the least amount of red tape and taxes.

   However, before we get too far into estate tax planning, you should know that  the federal estate tax itself is in a period of flux. That’s because in  2001, Congress passed legislation that gradually decreased the estate  tax and then did away with it entirely in 2010. As a result, at the time this book was published in 2010, there was

   

   no federal estate tax. Not only that, but on January 1, 2011, the estate  tax is set to come back at the level where it was several years ago,  with a $1 million personal estate tax exemption and a top estate tax  rate of 55%. But all of this might change soon. Some senators have said  that they not only intend to bring back the estate tax in 2010, but they also to make these provisions retroactive to January 1, 2010.

   [Pretty  confusing, we know. In a nutshell, right now there’s no way of knowing  whether there will be an estate tax in 2010, 2011, or in the year you  die, so you may choose to take some steps to lower an eventual estate  tax hit. (To see if there has been a ](http://www.nolo.com/legal-updates)[legal update ](http://www.nolo.com/legal-updates)[for this book, which will explain any new estate tax legislation, visit www.nolo.com/legal-updates.)](http://www.nolo.com/legal-updates)

   But keep in mind that if you and your co-owners are young, you may buy and  sell many businesses in your lifetime, so the business you own now may  not affect your estate taxes at all. In short, younger readers will  probably be wise not to sweat estate taxes

   too much. On the other hand, if you’re in your 50s or 60s—and especially if you are older—you may want to pay close attention to this chapter.

   estate planning—and especially estate taxes—are complicated

   

   areas. In this chapter we provide only basic information about general estate tax rules. Once you understand the basics, you will be better positioned to further discuss these issues with your tax adviser.

   Also, remember, in this book we have focused on how owners of a small  business can limit and control the transfer of ownership interests to  spouses, family members, inheritors, and outside purchasers. Please  realize that this is a different goal from how a business owner can best plan her estate to minimize probate costs and estate taxes and to  assure the orderly and efficient passing of property to heirs upon the  owner’s death.

   

   

   Some people worry that their heirs will have to pay income taxes on the  business interest or money they receive after their death. This should  not happen. Specifically, any property your inheritors receive from your estate at your death will not be considered income, so your inheritors  will not owe ordinary income taxes. However, if your inheritors sell

   inherited property, they will owe capital gains taxes, and how these taxes are  calculated is affected by the stepped-up basis rules discussed at the  beginning of “Estate Planning,” above.

   

   No Income Taxes on Inheritance

   

   Estate Tax Basics

   Here’s what you need to know: When you die, the government may impose a tax on the property you leave behind, if you leave over a certain amount. In  2007 and 2008, the estate tax affected only people who died leaving a  taxable estate (including business property, personal property, and real estate) of more than $2 million. This threshold, called the personal  exemption, increased to $3.5 million

   in 2009. Property left in an estate above this threshold amount was taxed  at a maximum of 45%. But, as we discussed at the beginning of this  section, the estate tax was repealed for 2010, and what the future holds for the estate tax, we have no way of knowing. The exact dates and  amounts of changes to estate taxes are shown below.

   

   | Estate Tax Changes |                      |                         |
   | ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
   | Year               | Estate tax exemption | Highest estate tax rate |
   | 2007               | $2 million           | 45%                     |
   | 2008               | $2 million           | 45%                     |
   | 2009               | $3.5 million         | 45%                     |
   | 2010               | estate tax repealed  | N/A                     |
   | future years       | expect new rules     | expect new rates        |

   

   For the majority of Americans, in recent years the estate tax exemption was high enough that they never had to worry about estate taxes. But you,  as a successful small business owner, may not be able to rest as easily. If the value of your estate is higher than the personal exemption in  the year you die (assuming there is an estate tax), your estate will owe estate taxes, unless you leave your property in one of the few ways  that qualify it for a deduction.

   

   Marital deduction. The major way most people get a deduction on their estate tax is by leaving property to their spouses. Any property, including a business interest, that you leave to your spouse passes free of estate tax, under what’s  called the marital deduction.

   Because of the marital deduction, if you’re married and you plan to leave your  ownership interest to your spouse, estate tax will be an issue only when the second spouse dies. (Again, when the first spouse dies, everything  left to the surviving spouse passes tax free.)

   If the second spouse dies owning all of the couple’s property and it’s  worth more than the personal estate tax exemption, estate tax may well  be due at that time. So, even if you plan to leave your business  interest to your spouse, if your ownership interest and your other  property together are likely to exceed the estate tax exemption in place at the time of your death, you may want to think of adopting another  tax-avoidance strategy. Other ways to reduce estate taxes include giving away portions of your ownership interest during your lifetime, creating an “AB trust,” or using your buyout agreement to lower estate taxes on  your business interest.

   Family succession. If you plan to leave your business interest to your children to carry on  the business, you may need to do some estate planning. If you don’t, and you leave your share of your business to your heirs with the  expectation that they’ll take over for you, you could be saddling them  with such a hefty federal estate tax bill that they may have to sell the business just to have the cash to pay the estate taxes.

   For example, assume that Eric owns a business worth $3 million, which he manages with his two children. His goal is to leave the

   

   business to his kids, who have expressed a desire to continue the business. But  there is a major problem: Without planning to avoid estate taxes, if  Eric dies in a year when the estate tax exemption is only $2 million,  and the estate tax rate is 45%, his estate will owe an estate tax of  about $450,000. In order to pay these estate taxes, Eric’s kids may have no choice but to sell all or part of the business.

   

   Ways to Avoid Estate Taxes

   Before we describe how you may be able to use your buyout agreement to lower  your eventual estate tax liability, we offer a thumbnail sketch of the  primary estate planning devices used to avoid estate taxes—because these techniques may well prove to be more useful to you.

   

   Making Gifts of Your Ownership Interest

   Giving away part of your ownership interest during your life can help you save eventual estate taxes because it decreases the value of your eventual  estate, but you have to pay attention to the gift tax

   rules. Otherwise, gifts you make during your life can be taxed when you die,  at the same rates as the estate tax. (The government taxes gifts this  way so that people can’t pass their estates to their heirs tax- free  before they die.)

   Annual gift tax exclusion. First, know that currently you can make an unlimited number of $13,000 gifts (to different recipients) of

   cash or other property each calendar year, completely tax-free. (The  property in the trust gets to use the personal exemption of the first  spouse to die.)

   

   exAMpLe: Each year for the rest of your life you can give your son and your daughter  $13,000 each, without incurring estate or gift taxes or eating into your personal estate and gift tax exemption. Your spouse can also give  $13,000 per year to each child tax free. And both of you can also make  tax-exempt gifts to your children’s spouses and kids.

   

   [(Note  that $13,000 is the current amount of the annual gift tax exclusion at  the time of this edition, but this amount is indexed for inflation and  rises, in $1,000 increments, as the cost of living does. Check ](http://www.nolo.com/)Nolo’s website or ask your tax adviser for the latest annual gift tax exclusion.)

   In addition, gifts to your spouse, donations to qualified tax- exempt  nonprofit organizations (such as charities), and payments for school  tuition and medical expenses for family members are tax free.

   Any other time you give away money or property—in other words, any time you make a *taxable* gift—you have to file a gift tax return. But you will owe a gift tax only once  you have given away more than $1 million in taxable gifts over the  course of your lifetime (according to current rules). So, the idea is to make tax-free gifts of your ownership interest—to give it away to your  heirs in $13,000, nontaxable units.

   The $13,000 annual gift tax exemption is the basis for many long-term  estate tax-saving strategies. This makes sense when you realize you and  your spouse can give a total of $104,000 to four people each year  without being taxed; and you can repeat this act of generosity every  year. But keep in mind that as far as business

   interests go, this technique may be helpful only to family businesses. After all, if your heirs don’t plan to carry on your business, your co- owners may not want you giving away your ownership interest to your children.

   Giving away an ownership interest free of gift tax can get complicated fast,  but here goes. A common method used by many business owners is to give  their children small interests (valued at

   $13,000 or less) in the business each year over many years. Typically, to keep  control of the business, an owner gives away less than a majority of her interest (or, gives away only nonvoting interests).

   Unless your business is quite small, you may wonder if giving away small  portions of your share will work to save a significant amount of estate  tax. Because of a tax concept that allows you to discount the value of a small ownership interests, the answer is often yes.

   

   discounts. “Valuation discounts” allow a business owner to give away more of the business in one year while staying under the

   $13,000 gift tax exemption threshold. Essentially, owners can lower the value  of certain types of ownership interests for tax purposes, in order to be able to give more ownership interest away every year.

   The value of an ownership interest can be discounted for tax purposes based on certain characteristics that seem to make it less valuable in the  marketplace generally. One of these discounts is given to minority  interests (an interest controlling 49% or less of a company’s voting  interests). Based on the fact that minority interests are often worth  much less when a business is sold, they are valued by the IRS at a  discount.

   Buyout agreement provisions that restrict the transfer of ownership interests  can themselves make an ownership interest less valuable— this is called a valuation discount for “lack of marketability.” The rationale for this  discount is that outside buyers might not want to pay as much for an  ownership interest with transfer restrictions on it as they would for an interest that’s freely sellable.

   What all this adds up to is that when either a restricted or minority  interest in a business is given away, it can be valued at about 20% to  40% less than if it were a nonrestricted or controlling interest. And  when the discounts are combined (when a minority interest can’t be  freely sold), the interest may be worth 30% to 60% less.

   How do discounts help when it comes to gifting a portion of your ownership  interest? Simple: The lower the value of one percentage point of a  company (or share, in the case of a corporation), the more percentage  points (or shares) of the company that will fit under the

   $13,000 annual gift tax exclusion. For example, if one percentage point of a  company is worth $13,000 without discounts, an owner could transfer only one percentage point (1%) of the company per year to a child before  exceeding the annual $13,000 gift tax

   exemption. But if the ownership interest is eligible for a combined valuation  discount of, say, 50%, each percentage point of the company can be  valued at $6,500 for IRS purposes, meaning that the owner could transfer two percentage points of the company ($26,000

   Family Limited Partnerships and LLCs

   Family limited partnerships (or “family limited liability companies”) are  sometimes used as tax-savings vehicles, although they have come under  recent fire from the IRS. These business structures are really no  different from regular limited partnerships and LLCs, except that the  partners and members are all family members.

   Here is how these structures work: The owners of closely held businesses  create family limited partnerships and LLCs, keeping the controlling  interest to themselves and giving the nonvoting

   ownership interests (limited partner interests in limited partnerships or  nonmanaging membership interests in LLCs) to family members.

   Because these noncontrolling business interests can be subject to valuation  discounts, a larger share of the business can be transferred to family  members under the $13,000 annual gift tax exemption. By combining  discounts for lack of marketability, minority ownership, and lack of  control over management and income, the value of a limited

   partnership or LLC interest can be valued at a much lower amount than would be the  case for the same interest in a publicly traded corporation.

   The IRS attempts to disallow any family limited partnership whose sole  purpose appears to be to reduce taxes. In short, any downward  adjustments made to the value of a limited partnership interest must  have valid business reasons. Ask your tax adviser for information.

   

   in actual value) per year to a child before exceeding the annual

   $13,000 gift tax exemption.

   

   exAMpLe: A husband and wife can each transfer $26,000 (in actual value) of their  company to each of their two children each year, meaning that each child will get $52,000 worth of the company each year. Over six years, the  couple can transfer

   $624,000 of the company’s undiscounted value. (Without using discounts, the parents would only be able to transfer $312,000

   

   in six years.) The parents can do this until they have transferred 48% or  49% of the company to their kids, and still remain in control of the  business.

   SEE AN ExPERT

   The IrS examines valuation discounts very closely. Due to

   

   the opportunity for abuse, the IRS pays close attention to these discounts. We strongly suggest that you seek the advice of a tax expert before  using a valuation discount on your gift tax return. When you do, be  prepared to explain to the IRS why the discounts are justified.

   

   Appreciation. As an added bonus, the portion of the company that is given away during  life will appreciate in the children’s hands, not the parents’, meaning  that the children won’t have to pay estate taxes on its increase in  value, as would be the case if the parents waited to give their interest to their kids until after their death.

   It follows that if the worth of your business is likely to increase a  great deal in the near future, you might not be better off giving away  your interest to your children in $13,000 increments over the years.  Instead, you could come out ahead by giving them a large chunk now (if  you plan on giving them the business eventually, that is). Here’s why:  If the value of your company skyrockets, your

   ownership interest will be worth much more in years to come than it is now,  making it much harder to give away a significant portion of your  ownership interest in $13,000 increments. If, instead, you make a gift  now, you may have to pay a gift tax, but you’ll do so based on your  business’s current, comparatively low, value. Savings can result  because, by the time the business goes up in value, it will already be  owned by your kids—meaning that at your death no estate tax will be due  on the increase.

   

   

   Years ago, the federal government caught on to the fact that the affluent  would sometimes try to escape estate taxes by giving lots of property  directly to grandkids or even great-grandkids. The idea was to pay just  one gift tax, instead of two or three rounds of estate taxes when each  generation died. To clamp down, Congress enacted what’s called the  “generation-skipping transfer tax.” Now the government places an

   extra tax on property left or given to a grandchild—at a gouging flat rate of 55%. You can, however, give up to $1 million directly to your  grandchildren (in total, not $1 million to each) without triggering the  extra tax. Of course, this property is still subject to regular estate  taxes when you die (just not when the middle generation dies). When the  estate tax was automatically repealed in 2010, the generation-skipping  tax also disappeared. Until 2010, the exemption amount was the same as  the estate tax exemption amount (shown in the “Estate Tax Changes”  table, above). If and when Congress passes legislation bringing back the estate tax, the generation skipping tax will come back as well.

   

   Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax

   

   Using an AB Trust

   The following discussion assumes the estate tax will be reinstated at some  point in the near future. As discussed above, the marital deduction is a huge exception to the rule that all property you own

   when you die (over the personal exemption amount) is taxed before it passes  to your inheritors. This deduction allows you to leave as much property  to your spouse as you want without incurring federal estate taxes (as  long as the spouse receiving the property is a U.S. citizen). As a  result, many married couples start their estate planning by assuming  that each spouse will leave all his property to the surviving spouse,  who will then leave all the remaining property to the children upon his  or her death. Unfortunately, this common way of thinking can lead to a  substantial estate tax that could easily have been avoided.

   

   Let’s see why this is true: If you leave your entire estate directly to your  spouse when you die, your estate won’t owe any estate taxes because of  the marital deduction. (Thus, when you leave everything to your spouse,  it doesn’t matter if your estate is over the personal exemption amount  discussed just above.) But, with the addition of *your* property, your spouse will have a much larger estate—perhaps double the size of her original estate.

   This spells trouble if the surviving spouse’s estate will be over the estate tax exemption amount when she dies. That’s because, after your spouse  dies, she’ll have only one personal exemption—her own—to use against all that property. (She can’t “save” your personal exemption to be used on  her estate after she dies, even if your estate didn’t use your personal  exemption at your death.)

   So, unless your spouse spends or gives away enough money, as might occur if she is likely to outlive you for many years or your family will have  high expenses (educating several children, for example), with only one  personal exemption, your spouse’s estate might owe a big pile of estate  taxes. Put bluntly, in many situations (usually with elderly couples,  roughly the same age), using the marital deduction to leave valuable  business interests to a surviving

   spouse results in a higher overall estate tax burden when the second spouse dies.

   

   exAMpLe: Walt and Helen are partners with another couple in a luxurious resort spa in Utah. Each person’s interest is worth

   about $1.5 million. Walt dies and leaves his share of the business to his  wife. Walt’s estate does not owe any federal estate taxes on his  ownership interest, because of the marital deduction. With the addition  of Walt’s ownership interest, Helen’s estate increases from $1.5 million to $3 million.

   Helen dies in a year when the personal estate tax exemption amount is $2  million. Her $3 million estate exceeds the exemp- tion amount for one  person. Stiff federal estate taxes are levied on the excess ($3 million – $2 million = $1 million); Helen’s estate will owe about $450,000 in  estate taxes (assuming the estate tax rate is 45% in the year of her  death).

   

   One way around this tax is to have both spouses leave at least some  property directly to their children, up to the personal exemption  amount. That way, each spouse gets to use his or her entire personal  exemption. But many couples are anxious about doing this, worrying that, should the surviving spouse have high

   expenses or medical problems during her remaining years, she might burn through  her one-half of the total estate and need at least a portion of the  property the other spouse left directly to the kids.

   To get around this, it’s possible to devise a plan that will enable the  couple to use their two personal exemptions while allowing the surviving spouse to use the property left by her deceased spouse. Using an AB  trust (also called an exemption trust, marital bypass trust, credit  shelter trust, or marital life-estate trust), each spouse puts his or  her half of the property in trust. (The property in the trust gets to  use the personal exemption of the first spouse to die.)

   When one spouse dies, the surviving spouse can receive all the income from  the trust holding the deceased spouse’s property and spend the principal for the survivor’s “health, education, maintenance or support” during  his or her lifetime. At the survivor’s death, whatever remains of the  principal in the trust passes to the ultimate beneficiary (often  children or grandchildren), free of estate tax.

   Using the Family Business Estate Tax Deduction

   The small business exemption exempts $675,000 of the value of a small  business from estate taxes, for small business that qualify. This  exemption could be combined with the personal tax exemption,

   up to a limit of $1.3 million. In 2004, this exemption became superfluous  when the personal estate tax exemption rose above this amount. However,  if and when the estate tax is reinstated, if the personal estate tax  exemption amount is less than $625,000

   Lessening the Pain of Paying Estate Taxes

   If your estate owes estate taxes when you die, but your heirs want to hang onto the share of your business you left them, they may have trouble  finding the cash to pay the estate tax bill. Fortunately, the IRS allows some creative ways to pay them.

   

   Alternate Valuation Date

   The IRS provides that the executor of your estate can elect to value your  estate for estate tax purposes six months after the date of your death  (called the alternate valuation date). Thus, if bad times hit your  business or it simply misses a step or two without you, and it’s worth  less six months after your death than it was on the date of death, your  executor can choose to use the alternate valuation date.

   

   Deferral and Installment Payments

   

   

   ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_202.png)

   SkIP AHEAD

   For family businesses only. This deferral, under Internal Revenue Code Section 6166, is only available for heirs who are going to hold onto

   the business interests they inherit. If your family members won’t hold onto your ownership interest for at least fifteen years—for instance, your  business partners will buy out your share upon your death—your estate  won’t be allowed to defer its tax bill.

   

   The inheritors of qualifying small business interests can delay the payment of estate taxes for five years so that they can prudently plan for such a big expense. During those five years, interest accrues on the estate  tax bill at a low rate. Once the five years are up, the estate taxes may be paid off in up to ten equal annual installments.

   

   If your heirs wish to use this option, they can’t sell 50% or more of  their interest before the tax is paid off. If they do, the entire amount of estate tax becomes due immediately.

   To qualify for deferral and installment payments, the following requirements must be met:

   - The value of the business interest must exceed 35% of the deceased owner’s total estate, and either:

     n the business must have had 15 owners or fewer (when the deceased owner was alive), or

     n the deceased owner must have owned at least 20% of the company.

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_203.png)

     CAUTION

     Watch out for installment sales. The IRS will not allow an estate

     

     to use the estate tax installment plan if the ownership interest has been  sold to the company for a 15-year promissory note whose payments are set to coincide with estate tax payments. The IRS treats this as a sale of  50% or more of the interest. Your estate could be obligated to pay the  estate taxes in full immediately, even though you are receiving payments for the sale of your ownership interest over 15 years. You may instead  want to schedule a series of smaller buybacks over a period of years.

     

     Real Estate Valuation

     

     

     ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_204.png)

     SkIP AHEAD

     For family businesses only. These special rules are only available for heirs who are going to hold onto  the business interests they inherit. If your family members won’t hold  onto your ownership interest for at least fifteen years—for instance,  your business partners will buy out your share upon your death—your  estate won’t be allowed to value their property using these rules.

     

     In a nutshell, real estate used in a family business can be valued for estate tax purposes at its value for its *present* use, rather than its

     

     “highest and best” use. For example, if your business uses an old warehouse on  the edge of town as a storage facility, the warehouse doesn’t have to be valued for its worth as a strip mall.

     The difference between the property’s present use value and its fair market value is limited to $750,000 (beginning in 1999), indexed for  inflation.

     Several requirements must be met for the rule to apply:

     - The value of the family business must be at least 50% of the deceased owner’s overall estate.

     - The value of the real estate of that business must be at least 25% of the deceased owner’s overall estate.

     - The deceased owner must have left the business to a family member.

     - The deceased owner (or members of her family) must have used the real  estate for the business for at least five of the eight years preceding  her death.

       There are restrictions on the sale and use of the real estate for ten years  (and, in some cases, 15 years) after the estate tax break. During this  time, the family must agree to notify the IRS if the property is sold or no longer used for the business, and may be required to repay some or  all of the estate taxes if the ownership or use of the real estate  changes.

       

       Partial Buybacks to Pay Estate Taxes

       

       ![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_205.png)

       SkIP AHEAD

       This method is only available for corporations. If your business is

       

       not a corporation, skip ahead to the next section.

       

       The IRS allows a deceased shareholder’s estate to sell just enough of the  shareholder’s ownership interest to the corporation to meet estate  taxes, funeral expenses, final bills, and probate and other fees— using  what is called a “Section 303 redemption” under the I.R.C.

       There are two requirements here:

       

   - The value of the ownership interest must make up at least 35% of the estate of the deceased owner (after expenses and deductions).

   - The estate or the heirs (whoever is selling off part of the ownership  interest) must be responsible for paying the estate taxes and other  final costs. (They are not, however, actually required to use the buyout money for this purpose.)

However, in “Income Tax Issues,” above, we discussed that a redemption of a  shareholder’s stock must qualify as an exchange in order to give the  selling owner capital gains treatment. Normally, to qualify as an  exchange, the corporation must buy *all* of the shareholder’s  stock. Fortunately, a partial buyout of a deceased shareholder’s shares  to pay his estate taxes may qualify for capital gains treatment.

For a deceased owner’s estate or inheritors to be able to force a sale of  only part of the deceased owner’s interest, your buyout

agreement must specifically state that an owner’s estate or inheritors can force a partial buyout of a deceased owner’s interest. The key here is  partial—often buyout agreements (ours included) are written to allow the estate or inheritors to be able to force the company

or the continuing owners only to buy *all* of the deceased owner’s interest.

If you think your inheritors will want to keep their ownership interest  and continue in your company, and the company and your buyout agreement  will allow this, you can provide for this. By slightly changing our  provision called Right of Estate, Trust, or

Life Insurance

One way to protect your heirs from an estate tax squeeze is by purchasing  life insurance to be paid to your inheritors upon your death. Your heirs can then use the proceeds to pay any debts, taxes, and bills your  estate may owe. However, you shouldn’t be the owner of the policy—if you are, the policy payout will be included in your estate at death,  needlessly raising your estate taxes.

One obvious solution is for your children to buy the insurance on your life and own the policies. But you must be extremely careful to avoid having any “incidents of ownership” in the policy, meaning that there can be  no record of your making the premium payments for the life insurance.



How Buyout Agreements Affect Estate Taxes

SkIP AHEAD

If you or one of your co-owners does not plan on being succeeded by a  family member when you die or retire, this section may not interest you. Why? Paying estate taxes is less of a burden for  heirs who do not plan on taking over the family business—that is, for  those heirs who are bought out. After all, an heir who receives $1  million in cash for your ownership interest and gives the government  one-third of it is still getting a good sum of money. If this describes  you and your business partners, you may wish to skip ahead to Chapter  10.



If you are an owner of an intergenerational family business, and, after  investigating the personal exemption, the marital deduction, and gift  tax exemption rules, you’ve found that your ownership interest may still be subject to the federal estate tax, you may be able to craft your  buyout agreement to lower your eventual estate tax liability. By  “intergenerational family business,” we mean a business where at least  one co-owner will leave his interest to heirs who

will keep ownership of the business interests and work in or help manage the business for more than a few years. We include this section to help you pass your business on to your children or other relatives without being overburdened by estate taxes.



The Problem

For small business owners whose heirs will succeed them, drafting a buyout  agreement with an eye toward estate tax concerns can be important.  Here’s why: If the bulk of the property you leave to your heirs consists of a largely nonliquid (not readily changeable into cash) interest in a small business (for example, one-third of a large furniture rental  company), your heirs may not have any available resources to pay the  estate tax bill. If your estate tax debt is large enough, your heirs  might even have to sell the ownership interest and pay the taxes out of  the receipts. Or, if they try to hold on to



the business and pay estate taxes at the same time, they might have trouble keeping the company afloat.



exAMpLe: Dick, with the help of his three sons, Dan, Bob, and Jonathan, had built up a successful custom glass manufacturing business by the time he died. His sons inherit the business,

but little other property. Before filing an estate tax return, they hire a  CPA to do an appraisal of the business, which comes out to $5 million,  over the current estate tax exemption amount.

As a result, Dick’s estate owes about $2 million in estate taxes (assuming the current estate tax rate is 45%).

The glass company has few liquid assets—its capital is tied up in equipment and inventory, its profits routinely paid out as salaries and bonuses.  And Dick’s sons, who are in the process of educating their children,  certainly don’t have an extra $2 million lying around. Rather than  trying to make hefty payments to the IRS for years, which could hobble  the company, the sons sell the glass outfit for $4 million to pay off  the taxes. After all was said and done, they took home a measly $900,000 apiece. Because

of their dad’s lack of planning, they paid more estate taxes than  necessary and had to sell the family business and find other work.



The Solution

This is where buyout agreements can help. To avoid an estate tax squeeze, in some circumstances you can structure your agreement to legally minimize taxes. Here’s how: As we discussed in Chapter 6, your buyout agreement  will normally specify a price, or a formula for setting the price, for  your ownership interest. The key for estate tax planning is choosing a  conservative price or valuation formula (such as book value) in your  agreement. This can set the value of your ownership interest at an  amount considerably lower than its market value at the time of your  death.

The lower your Agreement Price, the lower your estate taxes could be. Keep  in mind that this will set the price not only for estate



tax purposes, but also for any transaction arising under the buyout agreement.

SEE AN ExPERT

please realize that using your buyout agreement to avoid estate taxes is a  relatively sophisticated form of tax planning, and can be a

tricky business. If you (possibly with your family members) own 50% or more of your  business, the IRS may think that your reason for adopting a buyout  agreement is to lower your estate taxes, not to set up transfer  restrictions

and buyback procedures. Since the IRS audits many family business transfers from one generation to the next, it’s doubly important to see a tax  expert in this case.



The IRS may accept the value your buyout agreement places on your business  at the time of your death if the price or formula you use in your  agreement represented the fair market value of the

business at the time you created your agreement. This is true even if this value is below fair market value when you die.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_210.png)

CAUTION

Setting a low price can be detrimental. There’s a danger to



establishing a low valuation of your business in an effort to save on estate taxes.  It could be counterproductive for at least one, and often several,  reasons. For one, if you have to retire early, perhaps because you or a  family member has health problems, you would want to be able to sell  your interest back to the company for a price that represents its  current fair value (not a price tied to the value of the interest at the time of your agreement to save on estate taxes). Also, if your heirs  decide they do not want to take over the business after all, but want to sell the interest they inherit, a low Agreement Price may hurt them. In this case, they might be better off receiving a higher price for the  interest and paying proportionately higher estate taxes.



The IRS will do what it can to prevent you from unfairly using an  artificially low Agreement Price to reduce estate taxes. The IRS will  accept your Agreement Price only if your agreement satisfies six rules:

rule 1: Your buyout agreement must give the company or the continuing owners an option to purchase a deceased owner’s interest from his estate (whether or not they ever exercises the buyback right). This is a very common  buyout provision. In our agreement it’s called an Option to Purchase a  Deceased Owner’s Interest and is discussed in Chapter 3. Many, if not  most, business owners include this option in their buyout agreements for nontax reasons.

rule 2: The Agreement price must be “determinable and reasonable.” Your Agreement Price must be able to be calculated easily and objectively  from your agreement. In practice, this means you must use a fixed price  or an objective formula (like book value or capitalization of earnings)  as a way to determine

the price of the ownership interests. (We discuss the various valuation methods in Chapter 6.)

rule 3: under the agreement, an owner cannot sell her ownership interest at a price higher than the general Agreement price. Your buyout agreement may not allow an owner to sell her ownership interest  at a higher price during her lifetime, at least without offering it to  the company or the other owners first at the Agreement Price. This means that the price that is applicable after an owner’s death must be used  in all ownership transfer situations, such as when an owner wants to be  bought out of the business—with the exception of a

Right-of-First-Refusal provision. A right to first refusal is okay only if it gives the  company or the continuing owners the option to buy a selling owner’s  interest at the Agreement Price, not at the price an outsider has  offered (discussed in Chapter 2).

Of course, just because your buyout agreement does not specifically say that a sale of ownership interests at a higher



price is okay doesn’t mean that it can’t be done—when all owners agree, any  provision in the buyout agreement can be rewritten or ignored. But if  the buyout agreement is ignored and the IRS finds out, you can say  goodbye to being able to use the Agreement Price for estate tax  purposes. Likewise,

if one owner (a majority owner, for instance) has the sole authority to  change the agreement at any time, the IRS may decide that the owner  wasn’t really bound by the agreement during her lifetime.

rule 4: Your buyout agreement must not be merely a “device” to transfer your business interest to your heirs without paying estate taxes. If the IRS finds that your intent in creating your buyout agreement was to lower estate taxes, it will ignore your Agreement Price and appraise  the property itself. However, if the buyout provisions accomplish a  valid nontax purpose— namely, keeping ownership interests within the  control of the founders of a small, closely held company—then it may be  okay if they have the collateral tax result of fixing the value of  shares at a price lower than their future market value.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_211.png)

CAUTION

Agreements made late in life are risky. If you or a co-owner is



in poor health or advanced years when you make your buyout agreement, your estate is likely to be subject to more intense scrutiny than otherwise. The IRS is likely to think that you created your agreement only for the purpose of passing on your ownership interest free of as much tax as  possible.



rule 5: Your buyout agreement must be a “bona fide business arrange- ment.” This requirement—which is very similar to the last one—says that your buyout agreement must have been adopted for a valid business purpose, such as  to limit ownership and control of the company to the original group, or  to ensure continuity of management. In other words,

a set of buyout provisions that have no “teeth” (that are



discretionary) will not look like the real thing to the IRS. Also, this rule means  that your buyout agreement must be enforceable against all of the  co-owners. For example, a buyout agreement that requires the estate of a deceased minority owner to sell her interest back to the company while  allowing the heirs of a majority owner to hold onto their interest would be risky.

rule 6: Your buyout agreement must be similar to fair business arrange-  ments entered into by unrelated persons in the same industry. If you use a standard measure of value—such as book value or a multiple of earnings—that’s commonly used in your type of business, you should be  okay, even if your interest could fetch more in the open market. But if  your buyout provisions contain a low fixed price that bears no  relationship to reality, you may have problems with the IRS.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_212.png)

CAUTION

The value of goodwill should not be ignored. If your company



has been around long enough for it to develop a good reputation and a  reliable customer base, and possibly even recognizable brand names and  trademarks, it’s a poor idea to use a formula that completely ignores  these factors. For instance, the book value method, which will  undoubtedly give you a low Agreement Price, is likely to be questioned  by the IRS if other successful businesses like yours are typically  valued and bought and sold at market values in excess of book value. A  formula such as capitalization of earnings is more acceptable for an  established, successful company.

SEE AN ExPERT

Beware penalties for undervaluing your business interest.



The IRS can slap your estate with a sharp penalty if it discovers that your buyout agreement grossly undervalued your business interest. If the IRS concludes your business interest was undervalued by 50% or more, the  IRS can penalize your estate 20% of the unpaid tax. And if your business interest was undervalued by 75% or more, the IRS can penalize your  estate as high as



40% of the unpaid tax. This is in addition to having to pay the readjusted  tax itself, not to mention possible interest owed, court costs, and  lawyers’ fees. Again, do yourself a favor and see an experienced lawyer  and tax adviser if you want to use your agreement to set the value of  your business for estate tax purposes. ●

uch of the work involved in creating a buyout agreement involves  considering and discussing your options with your co-owners and then  filling in the blanks. Most

knowledgeable and motivated business owners can competently do the work themselves.  But there are several issues that we’ve flagged throughout the book, and especially in Chapter 9, “Income and Estate Tax Issues,” that may need  the expertise of a tax planner. Other decisions involve a mix of  financial and legal savvy and are likely to be best made with the input  of an experienced small business lawyer or a tax attorney. In the  sections below, we provide a few tips to help you in your search for  competent expert information, assistance, and advice.



How to Find the Right Lawyer

Many small businesses can’t afford to hire a lawyer to create a buyout  agreement from scratch. Often a knowledgeable business owner can  sensibly accomplish the whole task. Other times, it makes sense to  briefly consult with a lawyer about your buyout agreement at an interim  stage or have the paperwork reviewed upon completion.

You already have taken one positive step in the direction of making your  legal life affordable by deciding to use this book to prepare your  buyout agreement. Depending on the size of your business and the  complexity of your agreement, your next step may be to find a  cooperative lawyer who will answer whatever questions you may have and  perhaps draft a customized clause here or there for your agreement.

You obviously don’t want a lawyer who wants to draw up an overly legalistic agreement from scratch, while running up billable hours as fast as  possible. Instead, you need what we call a “legal coach”—someone who is  willing to work with you, not just for you. Under this model, the lawyer works to help you create your own agreement.





When it comes to the tax implications of buy-sell agreements, accountants  often have a better grasp of the issues than most lawyers (except for

tax attorneys, who may have a special tax law degree). And an added bonus  is that although tax advice doesn’t come cheap, accountants often charge less than lawyers.



Don’t Ask a Lawyer for Tax Advice



Look for Names

When you go looking for a lawyer, don’t start with phone books or advertisements.

referral services. Lawyer referral services are one source of information. There is a wide  variation in the quality of lawyer referral services, however, even  though they are required to be approved by the state bar association.  Some lawyer referral services carefully screen attorneys and list only  those attorneys with particular qualifications and a certain amount of  past experience, while other services will list any attorney in good  standing with the state bar who maintains liability insurance. Before  you choose a lawyer referral service, ask what its qualifications are  for including an attorney and how carefully lawyers are screened. What  you may not get from any lawyer referral service, however, is insight  into the lawyer’s philosophy for instance, whether the lawyer is willing to spend a few hours to be your legal coach, or how aggressive the  lawyer’s personality is.

personal referrals. A better approach is to talk to people in your community who own or  operate businesses you respect. Ask them about their lawyer and what  they think of that person’s work. If you talk to half a dozen  businesspeople, chances are you’ll come away with several good leads.  Other people, such as your banker, accountant, insurance agent, or real  estate broker, may be able to provide the names of lawyers they trust to help them with business



matters. Friends, relatives, and business associates within your own company may also have names of possible lawyers.

[nolo’s lawyer directory](http://www.nolo.com/). Nolo offers a unique lawyer directory that provides a comprehensive profile  for each attorney with information that will help you select the right  lawyer. The profiles tell you about the lawyer’s experience, education,  and fees, and perhaps most importantly, the lawyer’s general philosophy  of practicing law. Nolo has confirmed that every listed attorney has a  valid license and is

[in  good standing with his or her bar association. Every attorney has taken  a pledge to communicate regularly with you, provide an estimate of the  time and cost involved, and provide you with a clear, fair, written  agreement that spells out how that lawyer will handle your legal matter  and how you will be charged. For more information, see ](http://www.nolo.com/)www.nolo.com.



Interview the Lawyer

When you call a lawyer, announce your intentions in advance— that you are  looking for someone who is willing to answer a few questions or review  your buyout (buy-sell) agreement. Ask the lawyer if she has experience  in drafting buy-sell agreements—most lawyers (including small business  lawyers) do not have experience with this area of the law. The ideal  lawyer should have experience with small businesses, taxes, and estate  planning.

If the lawyer seems agreeable to this arrangement, ask if you can come in  to meet with her for a half hour or so. Although many lawyers will not  charge you for this introductory appointment, it’s often a good idea to  offer to pay for it. You want to establish that you are looking for  someone to help you help yourself, not for a free ride.

At the interview, reemphasize that you are looking for a legal coach, not  for someone to draft a buy-sell agreement for you from scratch for  $1,000 to $1,500. Many lawyers will find this unappealing—for example,  saying they don’t feel comfortable

reviewing documents you have drafted using self-help materials. If



so, thank the person for being frank and keep interviewing other lawyers.  You’ll also want to discuss other important issues in this initial  interview, such as the lawyer’s customary charges for services, as  explained further, below.

Pay particular attention to the rapport between you and your lawyer.  Remember—you are looking for a legal coach who will work with you. Trust your instincts and seek a lawyer whose personality and business sense  are compatible with your own.



Discuss the Cost of Services

Especially at the beginning of your relationship, when you bring a big job to a  lawyer, ask specifically about what it will cost. If you feel it’s too  much, don’t hesitate to negotiate.

Get a clear understanding about how fees will be computed.

Some lawyers bill a flat amount for document review; others bill to the  nearest six-, ten-, or 20-minute interval. Whatever the lawyer’s system, you need to understand it.

It’s a good idea to get all fee arrangements—especially those for good-sized jobs—in writing. In several states, fee agreements

between lawyers and clients must be in writing if the expected fee is

$1,000 or more. But whether required or not, it’s a good idea to get it in writing.



Confront Any Problems Head-On

If you have any questions about a lawyer’s bill or the quality of his or  her services, speak up. Buying legal help should be just like

purchasing any other consumer service—if you are dissatisfied, seek a reduction in your bill or make it clear that the work needs to be redone properly (a buy-sell agreement that addresses your particular problem, a more  comprehensive lease, and so on). If the lawyer runs a decent business,  he or she will promptly deal with your concerns. If you don’t get an  acceptable response, find another lawyer, pronto.



If you switch lawyers, you are entitled to get your documents back from the first lawyer.

Even if you fire your first lawyer, you may still feel unjustly wronged. If  you can’t get satisfaction from the lawyer, write to the client  grievance office of your state bar association (with a copy to the  lawyer, of course). Often, a phone call from this office to the lawyer  will bring the desired results.



![image](file:///Users/thundermac/Downloads/Business Buyout Agreements Plan Now for Retirement, Death, Divorce Or Owner Disagreements, 5th Edition by Anthony Mancuso, Bethany K. Laurence (z-lib.org)/Image_215.png)

How Lawyers Charge for Legal Services

There are no across-the-board rules on how lawyers’ fees are to be charged.  Expect to be charged by one of the following methods:

- By the hour. In most parts of the United States, you can get competent services for  your small business for $150 to $250 an hour. Newer attorneys still in  the process of building a practice may be available for paperwork  review, legal research, and other types of legal work at lower rates.

- Flat fee for a specific job. Under this arrangement, you pay the agreed-upon amount for a given project,  regardless of how much or how little time the lawyer spends.  Particularly when you first begin working with a lawyer and are worried  about hourly costs getting out of control, negotiating a flat fee for a  specific job can make sense. For example, the lawyer may draw up a  simple real estate purchase agreement for $300 or review and finalize  your buy-sell agreement for $500.

- retainer. Some corporations can afford to pay relatively modest amounts to keep a  business lawyer on retainer for ongoing phone or in-person  consultations, routine premeeting minutes review or resolution  preparation, and other business matters during

  the year. Of course, your retainer won’t cover a full-blown legal crisis,  but it can help you take care of ongoing minutes and other legal  paperwork (for example, contract or special real estate paperwork) when  you need a hand.

  

  Finding the Right Tax Adviser

  Buyout scenarios necessarily involve tax issues and questions, such as, “Is it more tax advantageous to have the company itself or the continuing  owners buy a departing owner’s interest?” Fortunately, many of these  issues won’t raise their ugly heads until it’s time for an actual  buyout. But while you’re forming your buyout agreement, you may have  concerns about the tax aspects of the various buyout provisions we  provide. To get good answers in these areas, you may require the expert  advice of a tax adviser. Depending on the issue before you, this advisor may be a certified public accountant, a financial or investment  advisor, or a buy-sell agreement specialist.

  Whatever your arrangement, consider the same issues for finding, choosing, and  using a tax professional as those discussed above for legal services.  Shop around for someone who is recommended by small business owners you  respect, or who is otherwise known to you as qualified for the task.  Again, you may be able to take advantage of the lower rates offered by  newer local practitioners or firms. Your tax person should be available  over

  the phone to answer routine questions, or by mail or fax to handle  paperwork and correspondence, with a minimum of formality or ritual. It  is likely that you will spend much more time dealing with your tax  adviser than your legal adviser, so be particularly attentive to the  personal side of this relationship.

  Tax issues are often cloudy and subject to a range of interpreta- tions and strategies, so it is absolutely essential that you discuss and agree to the level of tax aggressiveness you expect from your

  adviser. Some small business owners want to live on the edge, saving every  possible tax dollar even at the risk that their tax practices will be  challenged by the IRS or state tax agents. Others are willing to pay a  bit more in taxes to gain an extra measure of peace of mind.

  Whatever your tax strategy, make sure you find a tax adviser who feels the same  way you do, or is willing to defer to your more liberal or conservative  tax tendencies.

  

  As with legal issues that affect your business, it pays to learn the  basics about business and employment taxation. Not only will you have to buy less help from professionals, but you’ll be in a good position to  make good financial and tax planning decisions. IRS forms, business and  law library publications, trade groups, and countless other sources  provide accessible information on business tax issues. Your accountant  or other tax adviser should be able to help you put your hands on some  good materials.

  

  Legal Resources

  Law is information, not magic. If you can look up necessary informa- tion  yourself, you need not purchase it from a lawyer—although if it involves important issues, you may wish to check your conclusions with a lawyer, or use one as a sounding board for your intended course of action.

  Much of the research necessary to understand your state’s business law can  be done without a lawyer by spending some time in a local law or  business library. Even if you need to go to a lawyer to sort out a  particular legal question, you can give yourself a leg

  up on understanding the legal issues surrounding your question by reading  practice manuals prepared for lawyers and law students at law and  business libraries.

  How do you find a law library open to the public? In many states, you need  to look only as far as your county courthouse or, failing that, your  state capitol. In addition, publicly funded law

  schools generally permit the public to use their libraries, and some private  law schools grant limited access to their libraries—sometimes for a  modest user’s fee. If you’re lucky enough to have access to several law  libraries, select one that has a reference librarian to assist you. Also look through the business or reference department of a major city or  county public library. These often carry state business statutes as well as books on business law and taxation useful to the small business  owner.

  

  In doing legal research for a corporation or other type of business, there are a number of sources for legal rules, procedures, and issues that  you may wish to examine. Here are a few:

  - Federal laws. These include the tax laws and procedures found in the Internal Revenue Code  and the Treasury regulations implementing these code sections.

  - Administrative rules and regulations. Issued by federal and state administrative agencies charged with implementing  stat- utes, state and federal statutes are often supplemented with  regulations that clarify the statute and contain administrative rules  for an agency to follow in implementing and enforcing the statute.

  - case law. Case law refers to all federal and state court decisions, which interpret  statutes and sometimes make new law, known as “common law.”

  - Secondary sources. Also important in researching corporate and business law are sources that  provide background infor- mation on particular areas of law. One example is this book. Other secondary sources are commonly found in the  business, legal, or reference section of your local bookstore. You can  find practice guides on many subjects in most law libraries.

    

    Tax Resources

    Unfortunately, tax law is not as easy to learn as some other areas of business law.  The present tax code contains over 3,000 pages of very fine print and  changes from year to year. So, in many cases, going straight to a tax  expert will save you a lot of time and frustration. If you do have a  specific question you’d like to find the answer to and you’re very  brave, here are a few tips to follow:

  If you decide you want to explore valuation methods beyond the basics we  presented in Chapter 6, you can research any one of a number of  alternative routes. (But keep in mind that other valuation methods will  probably be more complicated, and the more complicated your method gets, the more sense it makes to use a time-of-sale appraisal.) There are

  a number of good books that concentrate on business valuation tech- niques for small businesses, including *Valuing the Privately Held Business*, by Irving L. Blackman (Probus Publishing), and *The Handbook of Business Valuation,* by Thomas L. West and Jeffrey D. Jones (Wiley & Sons).

  ### t

  

  he CD-ROM included with this book can be used with Windows computers. It  installs files that use software programs that need to be on your  computer already. It is not

  a stand-alone software program.

  In accordance with U.S. copyright laws, the CD-ROM and its files are for your personal use only.

  Please read this appendix and the Readme.htm file included on the CD-ROM for  instructions on using the CD-ROM. For a list of files and their file  names, see the end of this appendix.

  note to Macintosh users: This CD-ROM and its files should also work on Macintosh computers. Please  note, however, that Nolo cannot provide technical support for  non-Windows users.

  To view the “Readme.htm” file, insert the CD-ROM into your computer’s CD-ROM drive and follow these instructions:

  Windows xP and Vista

  1. On your PC’s desktop, double-click the **My computer** icon.

  How to View the README File

  

  note to eBook users: You can access the CD-ROM files mentioned here from the bookmarked section of the eBook, located on the left- hand side.

  

  

  Installing the Files Onto Your Computer

  To work with the files on the CD-ROM, you first need to install them onto your hard disk. Here’s how:

  

  Windows XP and Vista

  Follow the CD-ROM’s instructions that appear on the screen. If nothing happens when you insert the CD-ROM, then:

  1. Double-click the My computer icon.
  2. Double-click the icon for the CD-ROM drive into which the CD-ROM was inserted.
  3. Double-click the file “Setup.exe.”

  

  Macintosh

  If the Buyout Forms cd window is not open, double-click the Buyout Forms cd icon. Then:

  1. Select the Buyout Forms folder icon.

     Windows

     By default, all the files are installed to the **Buyout Forms** folder in the **program Files** folder of your computer. A folder called **Buyout Forms** is added to the **programs** folder of the **Start** menu.

     Macintosh

     All the files are located in the **Buyout Forms** folder.

     

     Where Are the Files Installed?

     

  2. Drag and drop the folder icon onto your computer.

  

  

  

  Using the Word Processing Files to Create Documents

  The CD-ROM includes word processing files that you can open, complete,  print, and save with your word processing program. All word processing  files come in rich text format and have the extension “.rtf.” For  example, the file for the Buyout Agreement

  throughout the book is on the file “Agreement.rtf.” RTF files can be read by most recent word processing programs including MS *Word*, Windows *WordPad*, and recent versions of *WordPerfect*.

  The following are general instructions. Because each word processor uses  different commands to open, format, save, and print documents, refer to  your word processor’s help file for specific instructions.

  Do not call Nolo’s technical support if you have questions on how to use your word processor or your computer.

  

  Opening a File

  You can open word processing files in any of the three following ways:

- Windows users can open a file by selecting its “shortcut.”

  1. Click the Windows Start button.
  2. Open the programs folder.
  3. Open the Buyout Forms folder.
  4. Open the rtF subfolder.
  5. Click the shortcut to the file you want to work with.

- Both Windows and Macintosh users can open a file by double-clicking it.

1. Use My computer or Windows explorer (Windows XP or Vista) or the Finder (Macintosh) to go to the Buyout Forms folder.

2. Double-click the file you want to open.

   

   - Windows and Macintosh users can open a file from within their word processor.

     1. Open your word processor.
     2. Go to the File menu and choose the open command. This opens a dialog box.
     3. Select the location and name of the file. (You will navigate to the version of the Buyout Forms folder that you’ve installed on your computer.)

     

     Editing Your Document

     Here are tips for working on your document.

   - Refer to the book’s instructions and sample agreements for help.

   - Underlines indicate where to enter information, frequently including bracketed  instructions. Delete the underlines and instructions before finishing  your document.

   - Signature lines should appear on a page with at least some text from the document itself.





Some of the forms have check boxes before text. Check boxes indicate:

- Optional text that you can choose to include or exclude.
- Alternative text that you select to include, excluding the other alternatives.

If you are using the tear-out files in Appendix B and C, mark the appropriate box to make your choice.

When you are using the CD-ROM, we recommend doing the following:



optional text

Delete optional text you do not want to include and keep that which you do. In either case, delete the check box and the italicized instructions.

If you choose to delete an optional numbered clause, renumber the subsequent clauses after deleting it.

Alternative text

Delete the alternatives that you do not want to include first. Then delete the remaining check boxes, as well as the italicized instructions saying  that you need to select one of the alternatives provided.



Editing Forms That Have Optional or Alternative Text



Printing Out the Document

Use your word processor’s or text editor’s print command to print out your document.



Saving Your Document

Use the Save As command to save and rename your document. You will be unable to use the Save command because the files are “read- only.” If you save the file without  renaming it, the underlines that indicate where you need to enter your  information will be lost, and you will be unable to create a new  document with this file without recopying the original file from the  CD-ROM.

​                                                                                                                             , and

​                                                                                                                    (“owners”),

and (“company”).

Owners wish to restrict the ownership of the company to the present owners and to persons with whom they may comfortably and easily deal, and to  provide for the purchase of the ownership interest of any owner who dies or otherwise withdraws under the terms of this agreement.

The legal existence of the company shall not terminate upon the addition of a new owner or the transfer of an owner’s interest under this  agreement, or the death, withdrawal, bankruptcy, or expulsion of an  owner.
