Board of Law Examiners Appointed by the Supreme Court of Texas

**Texas Bar Examination General Instructions** **Tuesday, February 23, 2021 – Wednesday, February 24, 2021**

**Overview of Remote Exam**

We will administer the examination remotely using Examplify, with ExamID and ExamMonitor tools to provide identity verification via facial recognition, audio/video recording with artificial intelligence, and human proctor review. You will need to purchase Examplify ($80) and install it on your personal laptop or desktop equipped with a webcam and microphone. For more information, see *http://www.examsoft.com/**TXBar*.

You will take the examination on your laptop or desktop with a web camera and microphone enabled. All exam questions will appear through Examplify on your laptop or desktop, and you will answer all questions using your laptop or desktop. Scratch paper is allowed on the MPTs—otherwise, the remote exam is paperless.

You will take the exam in a private room at a location arranged by you--home, library, law school, office, etc. No one else can be in the room during any exam session.

About 15 minutes before each session starts, you will retrieve a password—by email, from one of three websites, or if needed by calling the BLE—and use the password to log in to Examplify.

You must remain seated within view of the webcam for the entirety of each testing session. You will have unproctored breaks between each testing session during which you will not be recorded and may leave your seat to use the restroom, stretch, etc.

**Exam Day Procedures**

**1. Examinee Number**

The bar exam is processed and scored entirely by your randomly assigned 5-digit examinee number, also referred to as your test taker ID number.

**2. Exam Day Passwords**

6

If you are an accommodated examinee, the BLE will email your password to you about

15 minutes before each exam. You may also call the BLE at (512) 463-1621, and we will

tell you the password.

**3.**

You will need a password to access each exam session, and you will need to be connected to the internet to retrieve each password. Each exam session has its own password. You need to retrieve a new password before each exam session.

Each password will be posted about 15 minutes before a session begins. About 15 minutes before each session:

- ExamSoft will email the password to the email you have on file with ExamSoft

- The password will be posted at each of these sites:

  o http://www.examsoft.com/TXBar
   o https://bar.examsoft.io/txbar
   o www.ble.texas.gov, in the New Announcements box

- You may call the BLE at (512) 463-1621, and we will tell you the password.

  You only need to retrieve the password once, either from your email or from one of the sites listed above. The same passwords will be posted through all the channels. If you retrieve a password from one of these sites, you do not need to retrieve anything from any other site.

  Additional information about exam day procedures is posted here:

  *http://www.examsoft.com/**TXBar*.
   **Stay in Your Seat During Each Exam Session**

  You are expected to remain in your seat, in view of your webcam, during each 90- minute exam session. You cannot leave your seat until you have finished that session.

  If you must leave your seat during any exam session in response to an emergency, you should (if possible) find a stopping point in the exam where you have not yet viewed upcoming materials and will not go back to review past answers, and announce the reason you must leave so that your explanation for leaving your seat can be recorded. Leaving your seat will not automatically disqualify you from the exam—we understand that unanticipated events might occur. However, leaving your seat during the exam means that you have had unproctored access to materials during the exam, and we will investigate. If you preview material before leaving your seat, or if you return to answers that you entered before leaving seat, we may not be able to score those parts of your exam.

**4. ScratchPaperfortheMPTs**

**5.**

**6.**

**7.**

You may use physical scratch paper and writing instruments during the MPTs only. Scratch paper means **blank** paper that you bring into your Secure Area and that you then use to make notes during an exam session. Scratch paper must start out blank. It may be lined notebook paper or unlined printer paper, but it cannot have any writing on it at when the exam session begins

Scratch paper can be used for making notes. Nothing that you write on scratch paper during the exam will be graded.

If you choose to use scratch paper for the MPT, it is your sole responsibility to understand the following:

- YoumayuseblankscratchpaperfortheMPTs.Don’tabusethistotrytosneakin notes. We will investigate all anomalies.

- You may **not** use scratch paper for any other part of the exam. Having scratch paper in your Secure Area during any other part of the exam would be a serious violation of exam integrity and will be reported to the Board as exam misconduct. The BLE will have no tolerance for examinees who say they did not understand this.

- Make sure you understand the exam schedule. Do **not** have scratch paper or writing instruments in your Secure Area during the essays or the MBE.

  **Withdrawing From the Bar Exam**

  If you decide not to take this bar exam, then send a message to your licensure analyst through your ATLAS home page. Fees are *not* refunded and are *not* transferred to a future exam. If you want to take a future exam, you must submit a re-application and fees by the applicable deadline in Rule 9(a). (You would *not* be eligible for the special re- application deadline set out in Rule 9(f).)

  **Starting, But Not Completing, the Bar Exam**

  You may take the bar exam a maximum of 5 times. If you sit for any part of an exam, it will count as one of your 5 attempts. However, unless you make a bona fide effort to complete each section of the exam, we will not grade any part of the exam, and if you want to take a future exam, you must submit a re-application and fees by the applicable deadline in Rule 9(a). (You would *not* be eligible for the special re-application deadline set out in Rule 9(f).)

  **Technical Assistance on Exam Days**

  Because of the remote nature of this exam, technical assistance on exam days will be

  very limited. M

Any person who is authorized to administer oaths—including a judge, retired judge,

clerk, or notary public—may swear you in, either before or after you receive your license

A person authorized to administer the oath may administer it to you **remotely**, such as

**The Examination Review Process**

Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Texas provides two alternative methods to review your performance on parts of the Bar Exam: formal reviews and informal reviews. Reviews are not appeals or re-grades, and will not result in a change to your Bar Exam score.

**Formal Reviews.** Rule 11(g) provides for a one-time formal review, which is an individual, oral review of your performance on the Bar Exam (excluding the MBE). You are entitled to a formal review if you have failed the Texas Bar Exam more than once and have not previously had a formal review. Regardless of the number of Bar Exams taken, you are entitled to only **one** formal review. We must receive your request for a formal review 14 calendar days after results are released. We will notify you of exact dates and additional procedures after we receive and process all requests.

**Informal Reviews.** If you are unsuccessful on the Bar Exam, we will provide you with 10

a written Informal Review of your performance on all components of the Bar Exam, as provided by Rule 11. This Informal Review will be provided to you without the need for a written request. The Informal Review will include your final scaled score on each component of the exam: Multi-State Performance Test, Procedure and Evidence Questions, Multi-State Bar Exam, and each of the Texas Essays. It will also include your national percentile ranking on each subject matter area of the MBE.

**Scoring and Weighting**

Texas administers the Uniform Bar Exam. The minimum UBE total score required to be licensed in Texas is 270, reported on a 400-point scale.

The Texas Bar Examination has three parts, weighted as follows to calculate a UBE total score:

• MultistatePerformanceTest(MPT)=20%

- Multistate Essay Examination (MEE)=30%

- Multistate Bar Exam (MBE) = 50%
